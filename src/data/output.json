He didn't say anything regarding the enormous timeslots for the typical operations that we saw His point was that even if passengers paid for some services to get faster to the gate one hour is not enough and we had to come earlier But passengers should be notified about these critical issues in advance and have clear recommendations And it doesn't mean that airlines are free from any obligations to support passengers on site Nobody notified me that I had to plan 30 35 for each operation I would never go for it Overall conclusion No way Doesn't make sense to pay for the service if

clear three out of the four flights we had arranged months in advance were cancelled by JetBlue with just the flick of a text message I will never fly JetBlue ever again I am utterly appalled for what passed as service and the willingness to leave people stranded with no assistance There are few words to describe the service we received from JetBlue over this weekend but it was punctuated with an

boarding the plane I was told that I'd have to check my carry on I explained that I had a tight connection in JFK but was reassured by the gate that it wouldn't be a problem As we approached JFK the

to change my flight as if I had a choice When I said yes she stated that she would have to get a supervisor to allow her to make the change That process took about 30 minutes and at the conclusion she told me that I needed to talk to an employee at the terminal to confirm the information she'd provided me When I finally got to the front I was told that the flight had indeed been delayed and that I could have caught that flight and my bag had made it on the flight Why wouldn't the flight be on the departure screens So now I have no access to my bag during the 8 hour layover To top it off I
