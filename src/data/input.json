the worst air travel situation yet recently and that's after traveling a bit over the past several years I never before had issues with Jetblue but this past trip was a vacation that almost tanked because of the travel and had me not wanting to ever use them again Each of the 4 flights I had going and coming was delayed if not once several times then the final returning leg after being delayed multiple times even while sitting on the airplane for an hour was cancelled just before midnight with no other flights going out to my destination until late the next evening This forced me my co passengers and possibly passengers from what looked like another cancelled Jetblue flight to seek answers and alternatives for what to do at such a time of being stranded Many of us were not treated sufficiently and were not presented with acceptable options which is ridiculous Many were families with small children and by the time I got to a desk to speak to someone and ask questions of what was to happen and what available options were we were told their hotels had sold out and the nearest would be an hour away and we would have to find one ourselves but they would provide transportation There's much more to this but long story short I ended up staying at a nearby motel to keep costs low in the worst case of being totally rejected and not refunded or compensated for whatever reason

the gate the next day they told us we didn't have any confirmed seats in any of the JetBlue flights Same thing happened for a couple of days", "My 11 year old sister was onboarded The plane rolled off the gate and began to taxi for departure I could not longer see the plane so I left without thinking about it 2 5 hours later I get a call from Jetblue saying the plane never took off and she is no longer their responsibility Furthermore when the plane reboards she will not be allowed back on until the same person who was originally authorized to drop her off is there once again to see her back on the plane I live 1 5 to 2 hours away with traffic The fact that they don't employ a responsible adult who can watch after the group of unaccompanied minors until the plane reboards and instead inconvenience working class people with jobs is absolutely insane and unacceptable ON TOP OF THIS THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED THE DAY BEFORE Fortunately I was able to see the pattern of delays and left early Simply put They don't act like reasonable human beings", "I fly frequently Jetblue offers points if YOU spend a grand and pay it off fast 90 days For the small price of 99 annually they offer 40 000 points Just wait 8 to 10 weeks That is bait and switch Barclay card and Jetblue are complicit", "I booked flight 0828 due to depart on June 19 at 5 24 pm but I finally departed at 9 47 pm The explanation was because of weather that happens I know But the fact that they texted me at 3 00 telling me that my 5 24 was delayed to 7 24 only to send me a text around 3 30 pm that my flight was back on track for 5 24 pm After arriving to the airport on time I received 18 other texts and emails changing my time for departure I sat in the plane for an hour and then de boarded only to be told at 8 30 pm to wait for an INTERCOM ANNOUNCEMENT for when to board again No official time was given and that all other flights were booked and prohibitively expensive They refused to give me a time at the CS desk causing me to sit there without rest or dinner A weather related delay is not uncommon but the confusion and unprofessionalism there was legendary They lost me as a longtime customer so find another airline", "I am not sure why so many people are writing negative reviews although several are their own fault for not paying attention to rules like needing to check bags at least 60 minutes prior to an international flight this is not a Jetblue rule but FAA regulations and sometime up to the airport as well If they say you need to check your carry on there is a reason for it perhaps your bag is too large for the space remaining perhaps it is too close to take off time Remember the flight attendants are there to make sure everyone stays safe and to try to make sure the flight leaves on time Overall I have never had a rude employees and in fact they usually bend over backwards to help you", "I'm in New York my flight is due at 2 58 I get a phone call at 11 15 saying my flight has been canceled for June 5th 2 58 departure for LGA I was rerouted by JetBlue to leave or at 7pm I called customer service Spoke to Michelle after waiting almost 30 minutes on hold She then made a flight out of JFK to get me back to FLL sooner Got to JFK the same issue appeared The flight never existed I was then given a 3 40 flight which was boarding for Group A in the more room seats up front I was given a front seat However trying to board and was turned around stating I was on standby My seat had already been taken Who accommodates you got your inconvenience and how do you just switch flights when a passenger has paid for a flight for timely reasons I don't think I'll be flying JetBlue Poor customer Service and I've never been through this before I've always flown JetBlue Very disappointed", "I got an email that my flight was cancelled SIX HOURS before takeoff for 'maintenance issues' As we were going on vacation it was too late to change or cancel accommodations and car rental I was told by two supervisors Lesandra and Carline that my only options were to wait until the next flight which was TWO DAYS AWAY make a 4 5 hr drive to Atlanta for a flight tomorrow or just get a refund of the cost of my flight They refused to help me find another flight on another carrier", "Horrible experience My flight was scheduled for 4 pm and the flight kept getting delayed over and over We took off at 2 am I'm not even joking It was a real nightmare Worst airline ever Beware", "Received excellent service at my final destination Helpful with directions and baggage pick up as well Received multiple wishes for a pleasant vacation and hopes for a safe and pleasant return flight", "Overall Jetblue is the best domestically They have good flights and in general it is an easy process they are also super efficient with regard to impending storms cancelled flights and rerouting and refunding Most of the time the agents are polite and friendly however they need a little more attention to their staff in NY and Miami I think the seating is smart and works I also think the food is smart but wish they offered food that didn't smell Sometimes it can be overwhelming to smell salami garlic and other things in a confined space They should make sure to update their planes too and continue to offer the service that a lot of the other airlines don't I also think it would great if they introduced family flights during high family travel times to Florida Jetblue has always been the front runner on different domestic plane service and was better than Virgin America A little more innovation in these trying times for business travelers would be welcome", "I had been in Auto accident and had been diagnosed herniated disk lumbar and had lost the standing and walking capability Being alone in US and lengthy wait to see physicians I called Etihad Airlines and inquired about my possibility to travel to Jaipur India for quick surgeon appointment and surgery As per their wheelchair requirements I got physicians signatures describing my diagnosis and present traveling capabilities I bought tickets Then I was told to submit my medical records I did and my physician spoke to airlines providing his number for any future requirements meanwhile I got contact with neurosurgeon from brain and spine hospital Jaipur surgeon Dr Kamal through my nephew in India by sending a copy of MRI through Email I got the earliest appointment on 4th June 11AM", "I have had the misery of flying JetBlue twice a week for the last month Their points system is a scam They make it impossible to earn top status with the airline when you only fly short commuter flights albeit twice a week They define their points in a few different categories Only dollars spent on flights actually benefit your status with the airline No other points help your status I would happily pay for good service i e First Class They do not offer it Only more expensive seats that have been double sold and I have been moved without any explanation or compensation", "Traveling from Florida to Ohio and the flight was delayed several times and finally cancelled They do not work with other airlines for alternative flights We were told to come back the next day as they offer only one flight a day Instead we changed to another Jetblue flight to Pittsburgh and figured we could rent a car and drive to Cleveland The Pittsburgh flight was delayed several times with many gate changes but finally left several hours delayed I've flown many many times and this is the first and last time I'll use Jetblue Chaos should be their tagline", "Whilst trying to change my college students flight to the one prior it is the shuttle that goes every hour the rude agent said it would be 200 That is more than the price of the ticket I said that I was an airline executive and we pride ourselves on service and she responded that those days are gone and it's just a job It is discouraging to see how low our standards have been allowed to fall and that it is now accepted in all areas We deserve better", "BUG INFESTATION We flew with JetBlue and we took apart my kids' double stroller at the gate before boarding We handed them the stroller and they never put our stroller in a bag when they took it from us at the gate we traveled before with multiple airlines and they put the stroller in a bag transparent bag but anyways we kept the stroller extensions of the so they don't break while in storage When we received the stroller back at the airline door it was infested with thousands of tiny spiders We took tons pictures and the security advised us to contact the office", "Just flew with Jetblue for our first time yesterday We were delightfully surprised especially having been an avid Delta fan for so long For the price of our ticket from JFK SEA on Delta booked 3 weeks prior seated all the way back in coach not even next to each other We were able to pay 100 more and book a flight less than 24hrs ahead of time for first class and sit next to each other Jetblue's seats are wider in general and the interior is much more renovated and modern than most other airlines Flight attendants were helpful and polite I had numerous questions prior to booking which resulted in multiple calls Each time the hold time was no longer than 13 mins compared to the over 2 hours I've dealt with each time I call Delta's customer service Our flight was on time we departed on time and even arrived 30 mins early", "I am very disappointed Jetblue customer you ruined my honeymoon getaway with my husband I will never use your airlines again We traveled April 2 6 from JFK to Punta Cana our flight 369 was supposed to depart at 12 20 but due to the snow we didn't leave until 2 hours later That's fine We can't control Mother Nature so here goes the worst part We are boarded in the air happy as can be on our way to Punta Cana and the pilot announces there is a problem with the navigation system and we have to turn around and go back to JFK We then waited for 8 hours for another plane and crew to take us sure you provided credits and pizza but that is not enough", "I had to jumps thru hoops to barely make it on time to my dad's funeral And in the return I had to be late for work They delay flights more than any other airline in the whole United States and Canada They delay all my flights 9 times more or less And their price are terrible They definitely lost my business", "This airline it's a disaster never on time I do believe that people still flying with JetBlue because they always give a 75 dollars credit Back on August last year same thing happened to us in our family vacation to Cancun Mexico it was a mess We are so upset right at this very moment we are again in Atlanta waiting for our delay fly This airline is a joke I'm deleting my app from my iPhone It's not worth it", "Flying JetBlue and about to board the plane lady checking tickets gives the young girl in front of us a hard time about her bag being half a centimeter too long to fit in the check in bag requirements so they make her check the bag then our turn comes and we had the same exact issue and the lady made us both check our bags which is a huge inconvenience because we are traveling light and fast With no time to spare for waiting for luggage Long story short terrible customer service The staff could care less and the plane was extremely disgusting with food all over the floor and seats I couldn't be more grossed out and uncomfortable Don't waste your money flying with this airline", "Original flight on 3 20 got cancelled due to the weather The re booking was a nightmare Had to wait on the phone for 40 some minutes to get to an agent The agent tried to get rid of you ASAP by saying there is no seat available even though there are seats if check online Finally was able to get seats on the flight on Friday 3 23 the flight is delayed for 2 5 hrs and then delayed for another 40 minutes and still is waiting Avoid JetBlue", "Worst airlines to book March 20 21 there is snow storm on East Coast but every single flights going out of JFK are confirm for flying but only JETBLUE DECIDES 2 days prior they will not fly After requesting to change my flight they said they don't have any flights until Saturday I had book from JFK to Montego Bay Jamaica Have me such a hard time to refund I lost for my booking in Jamaica because we were flying back on Monday It did not make sense to purchase another 1000 ticket just one way", "I and my daughter bought Jetblue tickets 174 each It is total 348 Due to the weather I called and canceled flight No refund but 348 Credit Sound was okay however I should pay cancellation fee 150 each If I use credit It means I only use 24 each They answer I am sorry I understand What I can do They are not sorry and they don't want to understand because they don't want to refund and don't want to give anything back", "From 3 49pm to 7 30pm I received multiple emails of flight delays then corrected to on time then delayed then on time then delayed from 10pm departure to 1am departure I called the airline to complain that this did not seem as a weather delay even though it was insisted multiple times that it was but as internal issues seeing as they knew the plane from NY was delayed to us by 2 hours and we kept receiving multiple changes You can track a plane on flight aware and know when it will take off and land It's pretty simplistic", "The plane took off and landed that was about the only pleasant part of my trip We paid extra money to sit at the exit row only to find out it was not an exit row but instead a bulkhead with no more legroom than any other seat not worth the money You could not hear any announcements on the PA from the crew so never knew if they were asking you to sit down or buckle up it's not that the system didn't work the pilot's announcements could be heard the crew just didn't seem to care about their job They walked the aisle with armfuls of water to hand out twice on a 5 hour flight They had a cart that would have served quicker to more customers but only used the cart when a pilot need the bathroom to block access to the front of my the plane I'm assuming they didn't want to use a cart to avoid customers asking for more than a bottle of water", "I was told once the boards changed they would assign my daughter's seat and mine Then they said I had to wait until the plane starts to board However the gate next to me assigned a gentleman's seat whose flight was taking off after mine Very condescending attendants at the gate", "My first booking experience with Jetblue was in late 2016 for a flight to SLC Utah in February 2017 My first flight I actually took was booked in Dec 2016 and flew end of January 2017 to and from Las Vegas Booking was easy The first flight experience I had was excellent The 2nd was also excellent I was happy to see clean planes happy staff and relatively more room than other airlines I also loved the free wifi to keep my busy during flight making the flight time seem less cumbersome", "Non stop flight from West Palm Beach FL to Boston on 2 3 18 Our flight made an emergency landing in Charleston SC at 11 am because the engine light was on We disembarked the airplane not knowing what was next We waited in Charleston until 9 pm that night and they sent an airplane from NY to take us to Boston It obviously was quite an inconvenience But To compensate us Jetblue gave each of us 300 in our accounts brought food into the Charleston Airport for us and arranged a ride home from Logan airport to our home with Lyft at their expense We felt very compensated for the inconvenience Jetblue and Lyft are a class act", "I booked my wife and baby of 17 months old two seats They canceled the additional seat without my knowledge and when my wife was boarding they first gave her major attitude and problem with her DOONA which we've been flying with for the past year since baby and never have we had an issue They asked her and told her it's not allowed because it's not airplane safe Meanwhile she showed them the tag stating it's 100 safe", "I called Jetblue today to check about my flight I always have problems receiving the confirmation by e mail so I didn't have the confirmation number The customer agent was very rude and insisted that she couldn't find my flight using my name or my TrueBlue number Then she said I can't help you and you'll have to find yourself the information you're looking for DUH She was so stupid and inefficient She needs to be in an another line of work I called a second time and was told that JB would be calling me back in 10 minutes which they did but then I was kept on hold for few minutes and then I got disconnected I called a third time and I was then informed that somebody would call me back in 15 minutes This time the agent was very courteous and was able to help me", "I wasn't made aware of their rewards program but my only complaint about Jetblue is that I can't fly them everywhere My whole family back east loves them as a matter of fact would fly them more often if they had service and out of Hartford CT", "I traveled recently Nov 2017 on Jetblue Airways with my husband two young children and I am also pregnant with our third child After arriving at JFK a Jetblue attendant handed us our gate checked Uppababy Vista stroller in multiple broken pieces completely destroyed and unusable While I was upset because now we didn't have a working stroller to use for our children I went right to the baggage claim department and filed a claim with Jetblue It was clear the stroller was ruined and broken so the representative took pictures and opened my claim She said Don't worry Jetblue will compensate you for this Just call the number and it will be resolved Except it wasn't that simple Jetblue ignored my many attempts to get a status of my claim until finally I spoke to a supervisor in the baggage claim department that said I will need to have an original proof of purchase for the stroller in order to receive any compensation", "Over a weekend flight I was delayed 3 hours in both directions because they didn't have pilots weather and timed out This cost me two lost 1 2 days of work a family reception and a hotel room I only received compensation for one flight after calling twice It is not worth it if they can't compensate Despite all the perks of a small airline they can't help much when crew shortage Use JetBlue at your own risk If you need to actually get somewhere use Delta", "Despite Jetblue has a Customer Bill of Rights the company doesn't honor its own policies I have flown in several airlines and in the counted inconveniences that I've had the airline has always step up and offered me accommodations or any other form of reward for their faulty operation or change in plans This is my first inconvenient with JetBlue and despite the enormous time in advance that I used to purchase these tickets the best answer I get from your company is you have the option of canceling your reservation for a refund which I find very unprofessional after making a schedule change of over 4 hours on each flight and in fact the return flight moved a day back", "I experienced delays in most of my flights to and from the Dominican Republic from San Francisco There were delays going to the DR as well as traveling back It was worse traveling back because the flight from the DR was delayed for over an hour The only flight that was in time was the one that was connecting to SF that I missed because of the initial delay I guess the concept of port of entry is foreign to the employees because she asked me what happened I had to explain to her the process of immigration and customs Checking and rechecking the bag", "I'm traveling with my family of five We've been TrueBlue members for 15 years All of my children are TrueBlue members as well We arrived at the airport Due to inclement weather And traffic we arrived a couple of minutes late for our check in process We got to the counter at 5 22 AM with our luggage and was told that we couldn't check our luggage because it wasn't 40 minutes before the flight was scheduled to take off We brought it to the attendant checking us in His name is Paul He was extremely rude and told me that we're two minutes past the check in time and would not be able to check our luggage I asked him if he could make any exceptions where I was traveling with my family and it's after the holidays where the flights are extremely scarce and my daughter was returning back to college in Boston", "This is the 3rd time in a month of major delays in their service from Florida to New York Same supposed problem with fuel parts malfunctioning Toilets not working How can they claim their on time service when I have experienced the complete opposite", "I have never been treated so badly or have been confronted with such an offensive check in team and crew as on my recent JetBlue flight I was shocked that upon check in the crew were abusive to myself and my mother My father had recently died in a tragic car crash and I had to fly to California for the funeral On the flight out I informed the airline of the death and that I was flying with an ESA Service Animal I also provided the death certificate The flight from New York City to California wasn't an issue although on the flight back from California I was harassed from the minute I checked in The check in team who appeared to be in a very bad mood refused to honor my Service Animal ESA documentation insisting despite the animals paperwork that he was a pet and that I had to pay extra fees which is against the law", "Booked JetBlue vacations 8 months ahead of time Original direct flight to destination was canceled and replaced with a stopover Getting me there 6 hours later and taking 3 more hours to get there The second flight was canceled due to weather Trip was delayed by one day even though hotel and car rental were paid in full NO REFUND was offered The car rental was canceled because pick up later than 12 hours after original reservation causes automatic cancellation of car rental but no replacement car available You are on your own for transportation at destination Never again This company has no regard for the consumer Stay away", "On a recent flight with Jetblue I left an IPAD in the seat where magazines are stored Within 20 minutes I realized my mistake and notified Jetblue via email It was impossible for me to go back to the gate I was recently updated about my inquiry saying that they still had not located my item I am so disappointed that the item could not be located as I notified them immediately with all the information they would need to find the item Flight number Seat number etc It was not visible to other passengers deplaning so it is highly unlikely that another passenger searched the pocket of the seat So much for the plane being cleaned and ready for the next flight of passengers While I know there are more pressing issues in life I am saddened that the IPAD belonging to my five year old granddaughter mysteriously disappeared off the plane in a matter of minutes", "I have never traveled with JetBlue but other family members have so I booked a flight from DTW to BGI Barbados well in advance of my March 2018 travel date and was very pleased with myself that I had snagged an excellent fare Well too good turned out to be too good to be true The emails started coming in regarding time changes for the flights I'd booked I didn't stress too much because I know these things happen and most of the changes were no more than 30 minutes either way", "Firstly JetBlue connection was missed by their delays and crew couldn't help reschedule me to the next flight since they had other priorities I had to call their 1800 number Now the new flight is further delayed without any reason Really terrible experience don't recommend flying JetBlue", "I like flying Jetblue but am sorry they discontinued the one bag flies free policy I usually fly

condition that may prohibit my travel I was told not to worry because I Could the travel insurance That was a BIG MISTAKE The policy that was sold to me and never disclosed that the medical condition needed to be diagnosed with 120 days of travel My condition was pre existing 160 days When I need to cancel I was denied This was a waste of 1 756 NEVER BOOK TRAVEL THROUGH JETBLUE or ALLIANZ the insurer", "Great prices compared to other airlines comfortable seats and good leg room We've been able to book direct non stop flights for half the cost of competitors and never had an issue", "I am an experienced travel agency owner All I can say is NEVER book Jetblue Vacations Price might be less than other options BUT service is horrendous They cancel their flights often They miss connect often They will then say your hotel is non refundable even when they cannot get you to your destination As much as I used to love flying with them and I did they are not reliable dependable or fair Jet Blue does not work with other airlines so you can not even be put on another carrier's flights Just trust me on this folks", "I purchase 4 tickets for my family on Oct 1 for them to travel on the 2nd of November JetBlue had cancelled all flights from Aguadilla PR for the month of October and they told me that by November all will be fine and that they will be able to travel without no problem Their flight now has been cancelled and they do not give a good explanation of why First they told me because the weather then because roads were block then because the power They moved their flight now for Nov 18 My grandmother who is 92 and my niece of 4 have to wait even longer to get out of the island The supervisor was not so nice She told me that they only way was to get the 18 or get a refund Now my family have to wait for a whole month to be able to come here and get a relief Be honest of why you are cancelling flights from Aguadilla PR I checked and many flights has been landed It feels you are giving priority to others", "After the devastating hurricane to Puerto Rico I immediately book a trip The purpose of my trip was told to get a generator to my family Jetblue told me I could not take a generator in a commercial airline flight But to my surprise I saw on Monday October 10th on WAPA America Lo Se Todo segment They were interviewing a lady that was just arriving to Puerto Rico in a Jetblue commercial airline with three generators That's the question I have for Jetblue Who was that young lady and what gave her so many privileges I just wanted to take a generator to my family also", "Everybody do free cancellation for Puerto Rico because of Hurricane Jetblue won't They return you credit because they said you cancelled it And you can never put credit to bank account or credit card the worst is it expired in a year", "JetBlue is so disorganized at times it's annoying Their mobile site works when it wants to and all the time the traveler is not only at fault but we suffer as a result Their attendants especially at Fort Lauderdale airports suck as well They're extremely rude and lord knows it's a good thing I'm not a psych patient Long story short I attempted multiple times to check in via mobile within 24hrs Couldn't do it Then get to the airport an hr before it is due to depart Couldn't do it Why not Because the kiosk didn't allow me to Then had to stand in a line for 10mins or so By 615 they closed the flight And yet I watched someone at the help desk next to me get checked in and bags get checked for a different JetBlue destination than mine but Mine was closed Really Traveled using JetBlue for over 5 years I will definitely be looking for another airline as my preference", "NEVER NEVER use Jet Blue Vacations They increase the price each time I went to book I had to call to use a credit due to hurricane Maria and each time I went to call the price increased from 144 400 This was done on three different day and three different

dollar trip was for pictures for government forms and I contacted JetBlue", "Never book any Jetblue flight again I have never been so disappointed and angry with a fly company Jetblue is just super bad and terrible They blame you on their own faults and pay no respects at all My flight was missed because the agent who was helping me not let me go to the gate but instead calling my reservation company Then I want them to provide a solution Instead of giving me options they forced me to take a offer I did not agree on Plus a security guy is appointed to look after me so I cannot walk to the counter again Excuse me What is this I never hear anything like this before Is it because I am Chinese Is it because I cannot speak proper English Super disappointed Never book any Jetblue again And why this have to be at least one star Should be negative", "My husband booked flights from this airline to the Dominican Republic for a guy's trip And due to the hurricane in the area Delta canceled

will do everything in their power to get you to your destination asap Special requests No problem they'll fly through a hula hoop to make it happen Most importantly their Captains and crew are by far the best in commercial travel Always on time up in the air quickly and dodging bad weather ahead of time is their specialty I have flown most all over the world so I speak from experience", "In order

with Judy then Glenda asking them to call HPN and find out why my daughter was told that she would be the only one on the delayed flight Spoke to supervisor Tricia who assured me that she would not be alone on the plane but that the plane was not full Which is fine as long as she does not fly alone as the only passenger Why did I have to speak to three people before I receive a satisfactory answer

also ended up sitting several hours in the airport before my return flight where I witnessed at least 4 flights that the last loaded passengers were forced to check baggage since the bins were full

most importantly never lost a suitcase My thoughts on Jetblue dramatically went down after the problems began close to the day of my flight A few days before my flight I had a family emergency come up regarding a family member with a very serious health condition which I can prove I called Jetblue never thinking it was going to be a problem to change the day of my return flight They were willing to change the flight to the day before ONLY if I paid a large fee as well as a difference in air fare They were willing to waive one of those fees only if they could prove if my family emergency was

problems with getting back to work Was told to call and get customer service to help change tickets and when I called they said there was nothing they could do All the connecting flights to my home

not suggest flying Jetblue", "I got my ticket for boarding and was in seat 17E I don't like to fly alone so I asked if I could sit with my boyfriend It didn't work out which is totally ok But upon seating there were 2 open seats up in 11E and 11F I went up there and stay with him Well I was told to go back to my seat in 17E because those seats were located next to a fire escape which has more leg room Apparently they are more expensive so I moved without an issue But when I got back to my seat another random couple went up from their seats and sat there and it was ok I'm upset with the

if we had a wheelchair I said we didn't and he brought a wheelchair which was totally inappropriate and very dangerous for a handicapped", "For us JetBlue's competitive edge has always been outstanding service Truly caring about their customers and when they mess up everyone does doing what's right and fair by them The only other difference from their competitors is that one free bag But who cares about a free bag when you get treated like they couldn't care less about your business I gave them every opportunity to be fair with me Not only did they refuse to do so they wouldn't even give me the dignity of a phone conversation Immediately after the incident it took me weeks to get someone on the phone I was promised a Central Baggage Supervisor would call me back She never did When I finally tried her again she acted extremely annoyed that I would bother her and rushed me off the phone The only information I received in the mere seconds she deigned to give me was that the

the other airline called them to assist in getting the flight changed Jet Blue was unwilling to change it and re charged the FULL FARE The other airline was appalled We talked to a supervisor who was extremely rude and unprofessional to say the least but completely disinterested in how unreasonable she was being I have never been so poorly treated or outrageously overcharged The whole airline appears to have a bad attitude and no interest in customers", "I made a reservation via the phone with JetBlue instead of online because I thought it was required for a minor child who is fifteen I

and they said that is was not that price but 559 with taxes When you confirm for the same flights online the 453 11 was with taxes and fees included I received an email from agent stating it was booked and 80 and agent said reply to email and hung up the phone on me I called several times and was hung up on several times Agent refused to call me back and replied via email where he did not

concerns and he agreed we need to reschedule for the next day as we would miss our connecting flight from JFK to Ireland with Aer Lingus I asked what was the delay and was told all jetblue flights from JFK were delayed because of Runway upgrades Ok that happens After we got rescheduled for next day I asked what do we do now hotel etc Then the story changed suddenly bad weather was the problem

my friends from Dallas to Boston We all missed our flights due to unfortunate circumstances However working at the JetBlue counter went above and beyond to help all of us get on any available airline

cancelled If they cancel they do refund your money but tough luck with all of the other inconveniences and other flights depending on your itinerary that you will be missing as well as hotels cab and

150 for cancel fee and remaining amount went to a jetblue bank account as a credit with their airline How is this legal I could understand cancellation fee if my money was actually given back to me to do with what I please and short notice but Jetblue is still benefiting from the fact that I gave them a months notice to cancel and will charge a greater amount to someone else Not only that they are holding my funds against my will to use for their airline and it expires if I don't use it for 1 year Seriously how is this legal Is there a consumer class action suit of some sort against Jetblue

connection due to high call volume The website is horrible I cannot tell anybody to use a company that is this unreliable It does not matter how far in advance you paid for your tickets you still get last minute cancellation notice from them which forces you to try and get other arrangement for flight travel from other airlines at the last minute which of course is very expensive compared to booking farther out in time I had elderly in laws that needed my help and instead of having a professional courteous service I get a robocall without a human on the other end to help This is the last

after saying they would put the luggage on the plane it is documented they put an L on the luggage due to not processing for 30 minutes after the passenger was on the plane Then they said they would

seemed disinterested I booked the flight but very disappointed in their service behavior Guess this one will go the way of Eastern Airlines eventually", "I was delayed as the supervisor said by only 54 minutes and this was after the plane left the gate 42 minutes later from its original scheduled departure time Bottom line is that JetBlue will not issue a credit unless you as the traveler are delayed 90 minutes from gate departure My point to him was that I was heading to a destination that I arrived 1 hour later and JetBlue did not advise the airport that the flight had been delayed leaving from NYC I had another 45 minutes in travel by vehicle to get to my destination and the scheduled car service left thinking that my flight was not coming in again because the airport made no

missing any nice words like please would you thank you etc Her name tag was missing as well", "I purchased tickets from Jetblue last year My 6 year old son fell ill and I had to cancel my flight The airlines refused to give me my money and instead gave me an account number for half of what I paid I tried to repurchase tickets with the account they had given only to find out that they had expired So they kept all my money I never got a chance to use any of my money This company has a sure way of keeping money because they do not have any way of letting you recover your own money or partial amount of your money", "The flight was supposed to be a direct non stop overnight flight departing at 9 30 pm from Long Beach and arriving in Washington Dulles at 5 am Passengers were told the flight was still expected on time after check in Later it was announced as delayed but coming We ended up waiting over 5 hours at the airport for our plane to arrive It left at 3 am and had to make a stop in Vegas It arrived in Dulles at 10 am The online system and phone automated system both show incorrectly that the flight was on time I spoke to a JetBlue operator and I was told it was caused by the airport in Long Beach shutting down the long runway due to construction I told her if this was the case then JetBlue should have known well ahead of time that there would be an issue I asked why Jet Blue didn't inform their passengers She said she didn't know I am writing this complaint on behalf of my elderly parents who were the passengers", "Jet Blue advertises discounts given to military personnel in uniform That is a crock of BS When my grandson's flight was made to come home for the holidays my daughter asked about a discount The agent said the price booked was already a discounted price yet anyone who went online could get that discount so where is the military discount There is none unless you book the most expensive flight available So beware service people It's false advertising Our military men women in uniform should fly for at least half price Then when my grandson got to the airport he and the rest of the company had to go through about 15 security checks and it took a couple of hours", "I received a link at 3 00 am PST on 12 11 providing promotional travel sale to be booked by 12 12 for travel from 1 8 2 13 13 with 14 days advance booking In addition fare is valid on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and Saturday The site's main page advertised that the fare from Seattle to LAX is 89 At 8 00 am PST on 12 11 I logged on this site to this deal I tried booking for Thursday 1 17 traveling from Seattle to LAX This falls within the advertised restrictions however the fare is 127 I called Jet Blue about their advertisement and according to the representative the quoted fare is subject to limited availability She did not elaborate on this and said that that's the current fare right now The representative's attitude was take it or leave it", "On 9 Dec 12 at around 12 noon my wife and I were boarding JetBlue fight 154 from Orlando FL MCO to New York City NY JFK Upon entering the plane I observed a flight attendant female short brunette hair late 40's heavy set large frame and wearing glasses possibly named as Sandra boarding passengers on the plane As we approached the door of the plane Sandra stopped us and referred to a large group of passengers possibly seated in the row 20's in the middle of the plane that were having difficulty loading overhead luggage Sandra told us to stop and wait at the front of the plane She then walked to the group grabbed their luggage and attempted to secure them", "I booked a Jetblue getaway to Aruba We were told a couple of restaurants would be closed They didn't tell us there would be

Florida departing on Nov 1 2012 I had to cancel my flight because of Hurricane Sandy They gave me partial refund and told me to wait 10 days I waited 15 days and I called them back They said they did their part and that they did refund all my money I told them it didn't show up on my account and then they said call my bank I then called my bank and they said the refund that was processed is the only amount that was refunded I then called JetBlue again and then they said that there's nothing they could do and that it wasn't their problem anymore I called my bank Wells Fargo and they said that they would give me my refund even though Jet Blue wouldn't It goes to show that Wells Fargo stands up for their customers that they will actually pay for JetBlue's screw up Thanks Wells Fargo JetBlue", "I just submitted a complaint last night but today I was able to come to a resolution", "I recently booked a holiday package with JetBlue The terms and conditions regarding the vehicle were unclear and as I arrived in another country where I did not speak the language I was stranded with no transport I called JetBlue in a friendly and polite manner and was constantly ridiculed verbally abused and they refused to refund my transaction I grudgingly agreed to a credit which I was told I would be able to use in any arena of the company flights or hotels or cars etc and that I would receive my credit in 5 10 business days I then called JetBlue several times over the next few months only to be ridiculed and verbally abused by a Getaways representative who told me I was a brown beater and that I didn't have any chance of getting my credit and despite my attempts to reason that I had apparently read the terms and conditions", "On 04 October 2012 I checked my Coach duffle bag at JetBlue EWR prior to boarding a flight for Orlando When I arrived in Orlando I discovered that my strap was missing I went to the JetBlue office on the baggage level in Orlando and after a couple of perfunctory gestures I was told chances were slim my property would be recovered I sent a registered letter to JetBlue offices and after 10 days or so someone finally signed for it and a week later I received an email saying in essence I was out of luck they would send my complaint to the appropriate team leaders for training purposes and that they would not replace my strap I trusted JetBlue with my personal property and someone removed my strap and lost misplaced stole it or whatever I will never use JetBlue again They are inconsiderate unsympathetic unwilling to help and rude and have no real skills with customer service", "We were on a flight from JFK to Orlando on September 13 on a trip to Disney World We had our sit and stand stroller stored under the plane and upon arrival in Florida the JetBlue employee brought it back up to us minus one wheel What are we supposed to do in another state with a stroller with a missing wheel An employee did try and help us by telling the workers to at least look for the wheel so we could fix it but they said they looked and it was gone We were forced to leave the stroller there with its missing wheel as we knew it would be impossible and a waste to tote a broken stroller luggage and two small children through an airport We then had to scramble to file a complaint with a woman who didn't seem to care at all that we were going to miss our bus Disney Magic Express to the hotel We were told it isn't their responsibility and we could get a 30 credit toward another flight What about the cost of the original stroller The cost of the 6 day rental in Disney World I have the receipts from the Orlando Stroller rental company and feel that we should be compensated", "Flying home to South Carolina and at JFK I was told to please put my video camera into my luggage Reluctantly I did so Of course when unpacking my luggage I found the slip which I still have that stated my luggage had been inspected The camera was gone as well as Mike's videos of his last three months before dying of bone cancer Michael was 24 Luckily I had made CDs of the tapes but this was a camera Michael bought just to tape his last days To this day and after at least 40 attempts to speak to someone Jet Blue got Mike's camera TSA told me that there were no cameras in the area that the suitcase was inspected and asked if I knew the name of the person who forced me to put the camera in the bag Of course I did not know her name One Jet Blue person told me I was an idiot for putting the camera in the luggage and another told me to go cry to TSA Over one hundred flights later business and family I have never flown Jet Blue again and never will How low can you go to steal a dead child's camera and then blatantly lie about it Still reeling from my child's untimely death I just gave up Just goes to show you the thank you for letting me cry a little more", "I have never been able to find a non stop flight from O'Hare to Ft Meyers for the month of March Each year my wife and I travel to Florida by plane but last year we drove Why is it so difficult to get to the JetBlue complaint department I don't want to be called just e mail me Thanks", "On August 11th my daughter's luggage was checked and when we arrived at Orlando from JFK airport there were missing items from her luggage Since I didn't notice anything was missing at the airport I obviously didn't report it right away Now they're saying I can't be compensated nor will the matter be investigated Things don't walk out the luggage and if it hasn't been found at the airport I assume it was stolen The policy states any loss damage or delay in delivery of baggage must my claimed in 4 hours Our luggage was not lost damaged or delayed It simply had missing items Their policy also states that baggage related claims must be claimed within 21 days This is a bag related issue and it hasn't been 21 days yet so I meet the requirements and should be compensated How dare they tell me no They obviously aren't looking at the policy instead they're just trying to be quick to deny me To top it off both flights to and from NY to Orlando were delayed and TSA is disgusting to customers", "I had a recent flight #398 from Orlando to LaGuardia It was delayed about 3 times We were supposed to leave at 4 13 pm and didn't leave till close to 9 00 pm I find this extremely unprofessional especially since I had to pay an extra 90 for about 4 to 5 extra pounds of one of my suitcases This is not fair I'm not happy with all of these extra costs but I have to wait up to 4 extra hours for my flight Come on guys really", "On August 8th I traveled on a flight from Orlando MCO to NY LGA in Row 7 Seat D Mr a large black man was the flight attendant I asked for a coffee and water and he asked me twice You want a coffee and water When he returned with the tray he ran it in to the back of my head and without apology asked Is there anything else When he served snacks I asked for two bags of chocolate chip cookies because they are so small He gave me one bag and after completing the snack service walked up the aisle from behind with his right arm extended and struck me on the top of my head with his elbow as he passed my seat and continued walking", "On June 21 I was scheduled to fly to Rochester NY at 7am with a layover in JFK I arrived at the airport two hours before the flight was scheduled to leave as I am sure you can look up what time I checked my baggage I got through the first check point showing my boarding pass and ID only to be kept in line for over 75 minutes I in fact began talking to some of the other people waiting as well There were ten of us on the same flight We were all extremely concerned constantly informing the workers that we were all going to miss our flight We were assured that they knew we were here and we would be okay More and more people were shuffled into this one line where baggage was checked They were put in the front of the line as we all continued to wait", "June 12 Orlando to Syracuse flight 8 05pm 10 45pm I purchased these tickets back in April 12 2012 It was my granddaughter's first time flying They went to the desk got their tickets and checked in Divina's luggage They then went to eat because they had two hours to sit around They got to the airport early so Divina could learn and experience everything with flying Bottom line is Jetblue changed flight time The girl never even mentioned flight time change at the desk Their flight left at 6 00pm There has been no notification", "I went to fly from Orlando to Washington Dulles airport today When I got to the airport and went to check in I was notified that the flight had been changed and would be leaving 3 hours later I was upset as I could have been in bed for 3 more hours but more importantly I had people meeting me at my destination some taking time off from work to do so So they were adversely affected as well I contacted Jetblue supervisor Connie on 5 31 2012 at 8 15AM eastern to get to the bottom of why I was not notified of the change Now stay with me here I am a TrueBlue member I booked this flight via my TrueBlue account I have an email address associated with that account yet Jetblue never sent a schedule change to that email account They don't even dispute that", "Due to a family emergency I had to travel immediately and was forced to cancel the flight that was previously planned Jetblue does not offer bereavement fares but since a death occurred they would waive the 100 change fee but only if my mother had died within 7 days of my flight Since she passed away outside of their timetable that was where the level of compassion ended How can an airline dictate how long they feel someone should take to die", "Recently I was traveling to L A from NYC and a bag was forced open and a video camera was stolen When complaint was made to JetBlue's listed complaint line an hour after landing I was told that JetBlue took no responsibility for the item stolen whilst in their care as I had not opened our 4 suitcases at the airport and the made complaint there I've traveled extensively internationally and can say that I've never seen anyone open 4 suitcases and spread out their belongings at the luggage carousel The video camera was only worth 200 so it's not a financial hardship though of course an airline that doesn't honor its responsibility and does not investigate theft by its staff would never have my custom again The previous leg of our trip from Chicago to NYC with American Airlines was without theft or any other incident within that airline's control", "Due completely to JetBlue's negligence the red eye flight flight 98 on 4 9 2012 from Denver to JFK was cancelled Apparently one of the flight attendants had an issue and the captain decided he would not fly with her At 1 am JetBlue claimed they were scrambling around for a replacement After an hour and a half the flight was cancelled Instead of arriving at 6 30 am to enable me to get to work I had to lose a day's pay and did not get in until after 5 pm that evening Their reimbursement is only 87 I feel I should be reimbursed more JetBlue should have backup for emergencies", "I have always heard good things about Jetblue and their customer service When I had a family emergency arise and tried to adjust my flights or exchange them Jetblue treated me just how I feel all the other big airlines would have I have actually only needed to change a flight one other time and US Air was extremely helpful contrary to popular belief So please don't be lured in with all the neon lights and fancy web pages Southwest still has the best customer service around by far Jetblue is not really concerned about the customer only their bottom line I ended up missing that flight because the only change they could offer me was almost 800 more than my original flight and they had plenty of seats and booking a flight on Southwest for only 400 When I called them and told them I wanted to cancel the flight they said okay but would not give me a voucher or anything I'll probably never book with Jetblue again", "Shocking customer service at JetBlue JFK It is with regret and disappointment that I am addressing this letter to you I have chosen to fly your airline domestically for the past 5 years either for my business trips to NYC en route to Johannesburg South Africa or with my family on vacation I regard myself until today a loyal customer The reason I fly to and from NYC so frequently is that I then fly on to South Africa which happens at least every month", "In July 2011 I booked a flight with Jetblue at a cost of 685 80 and subsequently cancelled the reservation There was nothing obvious on their site stating no refunds Instead I got a Travel Bank credit in that amount which must be used within 365 days or I would lose it So if I do not book a trip within one year I lose my money that's wrong That was hard enough to swallow", "Mar 1 flt 710 SJ JFK At boarding there was confusion and the attendant was upset Roughly she told me to move my luggage to the upper compartment We are senior citizens and were taking our medication while on the Air I told her Please be gentle We put our luggage and also the luggage of another elderly lady on the top compartment

everyone to abandon the plane", "I book 4 seats on Flight 781 from JFK NY to MBJ which was a fully booked flight My seat was 20c which was taken by an overweight person The flight attendant could not

even a refund for that seat", "Sadly I will never travel on Jet Blue again and I was a huge champion telling everyone that I know about what a wonderful airline company Jet Blue was My daughter was on her honeymoon in Key West My daughter became very ill and was unable to get on the plane as planned in the morning after having been up all night with profuse vomiting and diarrhea They called to reschedule their flights and the first person she spoke to before she was transferred and ultimately disconnected told her there would be a 50 change fee which is annoying but not to objectionable He then attempted to transfer her call and promptly disconnected her The next person said it would be a 150 change fee which is outrageous especially when right on your web site when one is booking a flight it states that the change fee is 100 and then he transferred her and promptly disconnected her as well", "In October of 2011 my friend and I purchased two flights to California and for events out of our control were forced to cancel our flights Jetblue was able to credit the amount to us with the deduction of the 100 cancellation price which left us with a travel credit from Jetblue of 446 70 My friend and I were told on separate instances that the credit could be used on any travel with Jetblue including cruises offered by Jetblue until it was time to book the cruise Jetblue's terms

word that my mom was dying My flight was scheduled for 8 45 PM I waited at SFO until 2 00 AM the next morning for the flight to take off There was no explanation for this delay just that our plane had

was in the hospital a day before the flight Even though I tried to explain to him that my son was driven home as a result of his delicate condition he refused to have the fee waived Mike did not try to understand or listen I would like for Jet Blue to waive the 100 00 fee This is the main reason for my complaint My name is Carmen I'm the mom My address is My phone number is Your assistance in

them your money JetBlue stole 400 from me First by not refunding returning my money when I initially purchased tickets even though I was penalized charged more money when I canceled my travel Then by

will be canceling my credit card and going elsewhere with my business In a tough economy the only difference between the companies is good customer service Overall I am more offended by the way I was treated over the phone The manager didn't even offer to provide a new credit that expires in one year even though it was Jetblue that changed up the schedules of the flights If Jetblue hadn't changed the schedule everything would be fine Instead I'm stuck with a credit that expires in under a year and having to scramble to find a new airline and canceling my credit card If Jetblue had provided us with a little respect and courtesy over the phone my feathers wouldn't be ruffled", "Flight 28 arrived and left Tampa late on 10 22 and so arrived late in JFK Kim stewardess from Cicero assured me

craft at 1 00 am Yes that is 1 00 in the morning We landed at 2 45 am We were the only group left sitting there while they were cleaning JFK Everyone on the flight really felt like we were treated unfairly Jet Blue offered a 25 credit only with them My team including myself declined that was really cheap and a poor way to show their concern I called Jet Blue and was told to go online and complain and someone would get back to me Well we all know what happened That's right no phone call no response just a electronic system generated response trying to settle us for 25 Wow I guess they call that customer service No call no one seems to follow up again cheap air line cheap service This equals frustration Buyers beware", "I purchased an All You Can Jet Pass allowing unlimited travel for one month It became necessary to change an itinerary The terms and conditions for changes cancellations indicated that you may make changes within 3 days of departure for a 50 fee The reality is buried a few bullets down where they say tickets must have an advance purchase including changes It appears that they are negating their first statement which is what most consumers would see and believe Ultimately it is a very savvy piece of doublespeak Is this legal If so I believe JetBlue has made a travesty of the law and duped its customers Please refer to their policy for Cancellations

service at a premium price A couple of employees for the airlines are there most of them with rude and unpolite attitude Staff was completely unenthused about providing a good customer service It seems that these individuals either lost the love for their jobs or were simply on auto pilot The aircraft look dirty and stingy with parts falling apart and dirty The lavatory was a complete mess I asked the staff for a bottle of water after using the lavatory and was told to return to my seat where later they gave me half a glass of water with little ice My guess is that JetBlue cannot afford to provide drinks for their customers since this constitutes a premium service A service of cranberry juice is a tiny 7 oz can Simply put pathetic This airline does not care about providing a decent service to the Dominican Republic because they are the only choice basically I truly wish for another way to travel to my homeland", "Boston to Detroit JetBlue is the worst airline I have experienced

that time unitl now every day I call them to ask the status of my bag They hardly answered and always promised me to call back but no one called me back After long time they paid me only 650 for delay

flight Unprofessional how there was no news for hours when stranded Then we got automatically put on the 8 30 flight when there were seats available on 5 45 flight and we had to fight to get on the 5 45 flight once we where confirmed to be on that flight it was taken away because they said they were reworking everything and we got put on stand by We were promised vouchers points and didn't receive

flight with Jetblue In short their policies allow them to cancel flights and provide no alternative without any financial responsibility if you need to book with a different airline My wife was scheduled to fly to Boston for a wedding and her flight was cancelled with no given reason She was automatically rescheduled for the day of the wedding which was not useful So she had to book a flight with a different airline which cost an additional 200 Jetblue refused to refund us for the additional cost of the replacement flight They later cited storms as the cause of cancellation despite the fact that there were no storms and the alternative flight my wife took departed and landed at the same times as the flight she was supposed to take with Jetblue They did at least refund the cost of their own flight so I'll give them a couple stars for that", "This is the first time I fly with JetBlue in many years unfortunately it is a total disappointment I will keep flying with Delta I guess

hour absolutely no communication to the travelers the gate area is packed with travelers they told us the flight will be delayed 2 hours we find seats few gates away I kept checking the screen in terminal D for updates only Delta flights are showing JetBlue flights displayed only on the screen next to the gate I walked to the gate one hour before the new departure time they told me the flight is closed I asked for the supervisor they replied with a nasty attitude you have to go to the baggage claim area to speak with the supervisor no supervisor available at the gate they say the delay was estimate they say all times are estimate although the screen at the showed 2 hours delay The only time that is not estimated is the flight close time they failed to provide their customers with the courtesy of communication It will be the last time I buy JetBlue tickets", "We were delayed 5 hours and 7 minutes flying from Orlando to DC It was not related to weather as very few other flights surrounding us were delayed We were told that the plane we were supposed to be on was coming from Nassau and was delayed so we were then put on a different plane coming from San Juan which was arriving at a later time Scheduled departure was 12 59pm and was changed to 6 07pm The flight attendant announced to all of us on the plane prior to departure that we would all be entitled to and would be receiving a 150 credit I even confirmed with her during the flight just to make sure I heard correctly 7 days had passed and I still hadn't received the email with instructions on where to find my credit they told us we would be receiving one within 7 days After being on hold multiple times I reached out to customer service on their website and received some answers photos attached I was told that we would only be receiving 100 because it was weather related and that's what the airport told them I received many emails notifying me of the delayed it delayed 4 times and never was it stated that it was due to weather Weather was not a factor that day for flying Either in DC or Orlando or anywhere in between It also doesn't state anywhere in their terms that you will not receive compensation if your delay is weather related however this is what customer service told me When I told her that the flight attendant told us all it would be 150 she said I don't know why they would say that JetBlue does not take responsibility for their actions they do not stick to their terms that are clearly stated on their website And quite frankly they aren't helpful and are rude", "We took the red eye from PHX FLL on our way to Cancun for our honeymoon We had paid to upgrade our seats to the first row When we boarded we stowed our single backpack about 24 x12 in the overhead We slept most of the flight I woke up to the flight attendant stirring through the overhead She took down our single carryon and attempted to move it to the overhead in row 6 I stood up and told her that was my bag She said it couldn't be up there I said why She said because she needed to put her bag up there I said why don't you put your bag back there in row 6 She said that overhead space isn't guaranteed I told her I know but my bag has been up there the entire flight She told me it hadn't I told it had she told me to get back in my seat Then came up and glared over the bulkhead at me and spoke to me with a very rude and condescending tone telling me that I was lying about where my luggage had been stowed and I should be quite and let her move it Finally the other flight attendant got up and moved his luggage then put my luggage back where it had been the entire flight The staff member sat in her jump seat and glared at me the rest of the flight I contacted Jetblue and their response was overhead bin space is not guaranteed I will never fly Jetblue again All of our other 3 Jetblue flights also had really terrible service One piece of our checked luggage had the front pocket torn off and contents lost The other check bag was handled roughly enough to break plastic hangers inside it", "Washington to Orlando Very bad airway Delay after delay with no justification no attempt at apology no compensation whatsoever and not even attempt to help customers I would never take this airline again", "New York to Sacramento To start off I was sitting in the aisle in row 5 Then a man arrived to sit next to me in the middle seat His arm touched my arm for most of the trip He wasn't huge but couldn't seem to fit himself in the seat allotted him I have personal space Not cool I looked forward to free movies to take my mind off my situation It was a 5 hour trip It wasn't working and after 3 reboots they gave up", "On my way to New York I asked for ear buds and was acknowledged and then ignored I had to ask twice and a second flight attendant retrieved me some ear buds On the way back to Palm Beach I had the same experience where I asked for tissues and was completely ignored after being acknowledged again I'm not sure if they were so busy they both forgot I am not difficult I did not ask for food or drinks Palm Beach airport was pleasant and quick New York was slow and painful witnessing a very rude pre security ID check person Tv shorted out as well Very unpleasant Before this trip I always recommended Jet Blue", "Orlando to Newark Unfortunately Jetblue customer service is not very helpful or flexible Their website does not provide clear disclosure We have been in communication for weeks and the best they could do is say that if we are not traveling in the next year feel free to give our travel bank credits to a friend or family member Terrible We were in Florida returning home on 9 2 We were watching the weather and the website for weather alerts due to hurricane Dorian We are not frequent flyers and have never been in this type of situation before On Friday 8 31 the news said that Orlando airport was closing for the storm at 2am on Monday We saw the hurricane Dorian alert with the travel waivers on your website At that point we expected the flight would be cancelled and we would have to find another way home We thought we would have to cancel the flight for a refund and then we would use the refund to rent a car to get home We would have called into customer service however the alert said you could just go online to My trips It looked clear and simple so we went online and the screen came up to cancel The screen had our credit card number on the screen partially blocked out with the amount This made it look like the funds would be refunded to the card There was no clear disclosure saying the refund would go to the travel bank We received an email stating the funds went to the travel bank We then went online and chatted with a representative We explained the situation and they said that only flights cancelled by Jetblue are refunded to your card We did not realize that was part of the waiver when cancelling We then asked to cancel the cancellation and we would stay on the flight They said the flight was now booked and they could not do that", "I will never fly JetBlue again Two major issues 1 Customer Service especially the Help Needs service desk at the airport in JFK are rude unprofessional and have zero interest in helping customers After arriving in a wheelchair post surgery I was informed by Check In that I was too late for the flight the plane doors were closed They sent me to the Help Needs counter to schedule me for a later flight While going to the Help desk the PA announcement was made for the boarding of my flight The Check In rep had lied to me They intentionally made me miss my flight to LAX 2 My family was in the process of relocating from NYC to elsewhere My daughter had to re schedule the flight she and I were due to take together on Sept 17 because of a related moving problem We re booked her It was a day of horror at the airport for her yesterday JetBlue employees did everything they could to delay and harass my daughter because I called the 800 number and tried to get a reduced rate on my daughter's unused plane ticket After paying for the initial one way ticket 233 30 which they did at first offer to allow a free replacement plane trip I wound up paying an additional 255 00 plus 75 00 because because they said she had missed her flight and was traveling the next day she was required to pay more money for her ticket JetBlue canceled her flight because they said she had intentionally missed her flight while at the airport This was a lie She missed her flight while they played games about getting her a refund and getting her on the next flight to LAX Then when she left the Help desk my daughter went to the TSA Pre check entrance where they told her she had too many bags to go through the TSA pre check She then returned to check one of her two bags with JetBlue against her better judgement 30 00 The bag went to LAX without my daughter because then they said my daughter did not have a TSA pre check number this was a JetBlue lie to get her to go on the regular line not the pre check line She has a TSA pre check number As a result of them searching her they said they were going to call the police she had something under her belt My daughter said sure search me Of course they found no reason to have delayed her Result She missed her second flight to LAX My daughter is not a terrorist JetBlue staff at JFK at the Help desk was most unhelpful disgustingly rude and offensive I always traveled JetBlue The way they treated me and my daughter was worse than contemptible They do not care about their customers I do not care to be so poorly treated by employees of JetBlue Airlines All the good that I ever experienced in previous travel with JetBlue was canceled by these employees this past week Oh when we tried to get her bag today that we were previously told yesterday was sent to LAX the baggage claim person at JFK said she didn't know where my daughter's bag was could be anywhere", "Salt Lake City to Bogot via Fort Lauderdale The cost for my flight was about 300 less than I could find with any competitors so I was expecting some kind of substandard service But I have no complaints at all I'm over 6 feet tall and my seats had plenty of room All flights were on time and I was able to volunteer to have my carry on handled like luggage without charge I enjoyed the entertainment system on Jetblue's recently refurbished cabins and I wish only that connectivity had been available on the international legs of the trip", "Recently flew to LAX from Boston on JetBlue the pilot announced prior to flight at the gate that the TV's were not working and that they would give us JetBlue points for the inconvenience Later I find out Jetblue does not give out points for issues with travel So basically I was lied to On top of that a year and half ago there was a technical issue on our flight and we had points given before we even landed a major reason I used to chose JetBlue first prompt customer service The other reason being the technology on board which is now dated and failing on a lot of flights The flight attendants on this particular flight were miserable and had no empathy towards the lack of entertainment nor the fact the power was not working in my seat Jetblue used to be a great customer first airline now it falls into the likes of being just another airline with ok service and amenities", "San Juan to Ft Lauderdale Very dissatisfied with experience and will not recommend using them to save a few bucks My flight was cancelled 5 minutes past boarding time We were to leave at 5am and we're at the airport since 345am The bathrooms both on the airplane broke and they could not fix it We were told on the intercom the flight was cancelled and to come to the counter to get rebooked The only flight available for me was the next day I missed work and lost another vacation day after attending a funeral Their compensation was to credit me 100 and I was told that is it I paid for a high Monday fair when the Tuesday fair was 100 less and the rep Told me there is nothing she would do for me Not even credit me the 140 difference in price your own airline and other airlines offered for Tuesday The rep then told me it wasn't cancelled it was delayed and left at 1039am She told me over and over it was delayed not cancelled I told her I was there and it was cancelled that's why 200 other flyers were rebooking flights Also you should know they do not have any parterships with other airlines so once you pay you stay with JetBlue I've not been treated by your competition like this and will not fly or recommend anyone to fly on this airline We're booking a reunion for 45 family members and will choose Southwest to fly My thoughts are when I pay you to take me somewhere at a specific time you do everything to make that happen or refund your customers It certainly wouldn't work the other way around if I were to change my mind at the last minute", "Cleveland to Boston Worst flight ever I picked my seats when I booked Got bumped out of my seat next to my boyfriend and told that I couldn't do anything about it They then mandatory checked my bag without my permission It made my trip much longer because I wanted to carry on and wasn't allowed to I was supposed to be sitting In the front ended up in the back Will never fly with this company again", "New York to Los Angeles I paid extra for the seat and as the Jetblue itself says nothing worse than to discover that your neighbor is flying in a better seat and paid less That was my case I paid more and I was by the bathroom with the noise and smell of it Terrible", "Orlando to Newark We were on tour at USA and Jet Blue staff behavior gave us a strange feeling Can not imagine that staff of a service provider in United States can act this way At first on MCO airport while check in they made two different ways of check in for two different tickets of my own family I traveled 3 weeks later then my family from DXB to EWR So we had two different tickets though while return was together I think Jet Blue staff while check in make their own rules that suits their convenience and not the convenience of pax Later at EWR the lady staff who was to take care of our bags was acting as if we are asking a free favor from JetBlue or their staff We were already tired of night journey and on top of that such behavior made me decided that hence forth unless some strong reason in my life I will never ever travel by Jet Blue even I get a free ticket Such a poor service and such a difficult behavior of Jet Blue Staff Jet Blue shall inform their staff that passengers buy ticket and travel using their flights We were polite at all the times then why act this way Jet Blue Staff behaved like obliging us It was beyond our expectation even from humanity point of view No where in USA during our 7 weeks 4 weeks tour any one behaved so bad with us", "Bradley Intl to Tampa I booked a flight on July 31 2019 I printed the confirmation page including Itinerary confirmation Your all set to Jet and a confirmation code In September I noticed I did not receive an email confirmation I called customer service and after a 30 minute wait I was told that my reservation did not go through When I pressed for a reason the customer service agent hung up I then tried to rebook the same reservation 3 more times using 2 different devices After getting to the end for all 3 times the system timed out and told me to call customer service My previous experience with JetBlue was a round trip to NYC perfect and a round trip to Boston flight cancelled the way out and had to book on another airline the flight back was delayed 18 hours first for weather and then because they could not locate a crew We fly 12 times plus a year Avoid Jet Blue Their technology is a mess and they are short staffed", "On my first trip with JetBlue was a 9pm flight I hadn't eaten all day and forgot my snacks at home and the flight attendants told me I could have as many snacks as i wanted and could grab more anytime i wanted The tickets were inexpensive the attendants were extremely friendly and my bags were already waiting for me at the claim I dont think i could have had a better experience anywhere else JetBlue will be my first choice airline now", "Orlando to Atlanta We did not hear the boarding process being called even though we were at the gate an hour prior to take off The first time we heard an announcement was when we heard the doors were closing When we approached the desk to ask we were greeted with a very unpleasant Jet Blue representative who was unhelpful and threatened to have as removed Her first comments were you are late because you went to Starbucks except we went to Starbucks over an hour before coming to gate We had been at the gate at least 30 minutes prior to takeoff They refused to open the doors which is understandable but the way in which we were treated was unacceptable We were told to see the service desk who also were unhelpful and did not offer anything to remedy the issue There were no flights offered out that day as well as no information as what else to Other than That is your only choice I would put that in all caps but they would not post my review otherwise We ended up booking another flight out with another airline who were very helpful and apologetic even though they did not cause the issue We were able to get on a flight out within an hour Now that's customer service Maybe this airline should send employees to get trained by another airline agency Until then I refuse to fly this airline again because I feel all should be treated with a little bit of courtesy", "New Orleans to New York We were in boarding group E since we didn't want to pay more After watching others load onto the plane with more than 2 carry on bags and cabin staff luggage on board we were informed that there was no room for our carry on It would have to be checked at the gate We were seated in the front part of the aircraft and yet somehow when we were deplaning people who had sat in front of us were either waiting or walking towards our row to retrieve their luggage", "I was scheduled to fly on JetBlue from Worcester Ma to Orlando Fl on 8 9 19 After multiple delays spanning 11 hours the flight was canceled due to 'mechanical issues' crew time limits etc We were all told that we would each receive 350 in 'travel credits' Then I got to stand in line for another 30 minutes at 2 am to re book During my stay in line I saw that I now had an email from JetBlue stating that I was scheduled to fly out at 6 am in a few hours on another plane go thru JFK and spend 7 hrs there before flying on to Orlando Pretty unappealing since I just had my nonstop canceled and I was exhausted I ended up getting rescheduled for a flight 2 days later Of course I had to call my girlfriend at 3 am to pick me up by now On 8 28 19 after my stay in Orlando I tried to check in online and to print my boarding pass My confirmation code was 'not found' I tried the hotel's computers and the phone app I was able however after a 18 minute wait to reach a real person at JetBlue They told me I was in the system but would have to check in at the airport the next day when I was flying back to Worcester Awesome So on 8 29 19 I checked in at the airport While there I asked why I'd received an email from JetBlue Reservations with my itinerary and a cost that was double that of my original round trip ticket I was told that the cost looked ok in the system and not to worry unless I saw a problem with my credit card My journey with JetBlue wasn't complete until there was a 2 5 hour delay due to yes another 'mechanical issue' I made it back to Worcester Now I get to wade through 3 emails explaining how I get to use the 'travel credits'", "I am pleased with the service I receive with Jet Blue Airlines However on my most recent trip I did not receive the normal Flight attendant service I am a Mosaic customer and on my most recent flight when I the flight attendant was passing out beverages I asked for a Vodka and cranberry juice The attendant responded with there is no more Vodka on the plane which I could understand not having enough inventory if I was in the last few seats to be served however I was in Row 10 About 10 minutes later I saw a passenger ask for Vodka and he received 2 bottles When I saw the Flight attendant again I said I thought there was no more Vodka on the plane his comment was we located some additional Vodka so I again requested a Vodka and cranberry After waiting approximately 15 minutes I still had not received my drink I could see the FA in the front galley just standing around I had to use the restroom so I went to the front of the plane after using the restroom the FA was still in the front galley I asked him where was my Vodka he reached into a plastic bag and pulled out a bottle of Vodka I asked him for a glass of Ice and the cranberry juice he said I would have to go to the back of the plane and asked the Flight attendant back there which I did and she was very helpful", "San Francisco to San Juan PR We flew Jet Blue Mint I bought 4 tickets The flight from SFO to JFK due to weather conditions but that we shouldn't change our itinerary because the connecting flight was delayed as well so we would still make it on time However our connecting flight landed at JFK on time which doesn't make any sense and then left on time which meant we were stranded at JFK all night since it was the last flight 11 30pm The next flight was 6am We went to a kiosk and asked for help the girl wouldn't even look up from her personal cell phone until I said her name Keep in mind my children are 11 and 6 year old twins exhausted hungry and cold The agent couldn't help us she said because she didn't have a radio or phone to call anybody to help with water cots snacks or food or anything in fact including getting us on the next flight We walked across the entire terminal and waited 45 minutes to talk to somebody who said they were closing Mohamed said they had many delays because of construction at the terminal We along with 40 other people demanded they help us they promised cots and water and they never came After we went back to follow up all employees of Jetblue were gone I found a maintenance man to help and he brought water JetBlue didn't care about me and more importantly the safety or conditions for my little kids and their employees were beyond unprofessional lacking empathy or will to do the right thing Other airlines provide blankets snacks water and assistance Don't lie and say weather and then not even care for your customers", "New York JFK to Orlando On August 19 I had to fly out to Orlando Florida from JFK with Jetblue flight 1183 leaving at 2 5 and arriving in Orlando at 6 09 Grant it I understand issues happen and things delay an aircraft from leaving I get it However we boarded the plane 30 minute late WE got on the runway and they left us there for over 3 hours To a point my dad needed to get up because he suffers from blood clot However no one would let him get up They kept telling him to sit down which caused him health issues We originally had to drive down to Florida on Saturday but because of my dad issues we ended up flying If I drove to Florida I would be in Orlando quicker then what Jetblue did to us We got to the airport at 12 noon My dad had nothing to eat which means he couldnt take his medication After over 3 hours on the plane they finally got us back to the gate To let some people get off and others stay on the plane My dad stayed behind because his wheelchair was below the aircraft About 45 minute later they wanted everyone off the plane Jetblue refused to give us back my dad wheelchair that they refused to go below the aircraft to get it where I checked it in at the gate They wouldn't even give him a wheelchair that he had to struggle to get off the plane The guy was chasing us off the plane almost causing my father to all most fall because he lost his balance Then when at the gate the lady at the desk said her shift was over and she can careless of what happens at this point Wouldn't even give us any information A pilot had to come off the plane to find out why we weren't being boarded back on the plane to realize that no jetblue agent was at the gate to assist us Even after we landed at 11 something It took over an hour and a half for them to give us our luggage from the plane Many people are there complaining some with small kids Yet Jetblue was heartless disrespectful and did have a care in the world about the people waiting As long as they are making their money Knowing most of the people on that flight didn't have food to eat for over 12 hours Even the corporate office said they wont help because it not a big issue or the fact it didn't fall into an FA issue They even broke my dad wheelchair I had to rent one while at old key west resort That i even forward my invoice showing my purchase yet they still wont replace his damage wheelchair They cause me so much more money out of pocket a new wheelchair had to spend extra on my rental because the one I had reserved was given out because I didnt pick it up by 8 pm and had to pay to upgrade to another car Yet Jetblue wouldn't help me or my family Even passenger on the flight called to complain and no one would help them Also keep in mind Jetblue let flight schedule to leave to Orlando after us ended up leaving before us", "One word to describe my experience with JetBlue Airways disappointing In preparation for the departure flight from New York to Orlando we sat for over 2 hours on the runway Our flight kept getting delayed without clear communication as to why On the return trip to New York we experienced more of the same Our flight was delayed by 4 hours The crew members did not greet everyone or behaved as though they wanted to serve you I asked for an additional cup of ice water during the flight was responded to with a contemptuous will that be all As in please do not ask me for anything else I will never fly with this airline again", "Mexico City to New York This was my first international flight with jetBlue and it was a pleasure to fly with them Check in in Mexico City has to be done at the counter since mobile boarding passes are unavailable for the flight regardless it was a breeze I got an older A320 with no power outlets and non working WiFi but at least the movies were all working and the crew was exceptional two crew members remembered me from previous flights years ago and were extremely courteous and pleasant I had a full row to myself on this flight and the 4h20 mins it took to get to NYC went by very fast Once again a shout out to the crew", "Worcester to Fort Lauderdale Can't you get this flight to depart on time You continue too board us then have us sit on plane for hrs waiting for either maintenance or supposed weather pilots run out of hrs so have wait on new pilots or crew Who is doing the scheduling a 1st grader Maintenance delays for lights that are behind panels that are not even on a checklist but someone notices it so we wait hr for maintenance I have been flying jet blue for years but now time to look for different airline Maybe you should look at all your reviews as company 2 3 stars that should be embarrassing to you and to your CEO", "Orlando to Newark I had my and my family's two different bookings of flight by Emirates from MCO to Dubai via Newark as we travelled separately from Dubai to NY Our flight from MCO to Newark was by JetBlue I had a confirmation email from Emirates that I can check in from MCO to Newark alone and then recheckin at Newark for Dubai by Emirates to that I can add my bags from Newark JetBlue check in staff refused me to check in from MCO to Newark alone He forced us to check in from MCO to Dubai directly This forced me to make transfer resetting our bags as we already had planned bags to check in at Newark Later when I checked in my wife and son the other staff allowed us to check in from MCO to Newark without any trouble Now this made is so many troubles as we had no plan of reschedule our check in bags JetBlue staff had no regrets for their such inconsistent policies even though we were facing troubles As a matter of service Jetblue staff at check in could have read the email from Emirates but he refused to care about it In future I will certainly think before I book a flight and avoid with JetBlue", "I have always loved JetBlue and I tell my family to fly with them but my opinion has now changed and I am unsure I will ever fly with them again The flight I took today was terrible I boarded the plane and no one in the crew seemed happy I said hello and smiled as I do to everyone I meet and I didn't get a smile or even a word back and they were looking right at me One of the crew in particular was very rude and unhappy He pushed the cart around to sell stuff I bought a cracker snack box and he never said a word or smiled even with me thanking him and wishing him a good day the same guy brings the drinks and same thing The pilot never turned off the seatbelt sign there was no inclement weather or jolts and toward the end of the flight I hit the assistance button because my son had to use the restroom really bad and felt like he wasn't allowed to get up The same crew member comes and I asked him if my son could go to the restroom because he had been holding it all flight his response was no I can't let him go because the seatbelt sign is on and it would fall on him if my son got hurt so I responded um so my son can't use the restroom his response no at this point my 12 year old is in tears because he felt like he was going to go in his seat I asked well what happens if he goes anyway which then received an eye roll and him walking away from us I told my son to go to the bathroom but to the way the guy spoke to us my son was diving and saying he can't because he didn't want to get in trouble I finally convinced him and he went though as soon as he got out of the bathroom the same crew member felt it necessary to come over the speaker with an annoyed voice saying everyone needs to obey the rules and stay seated when the seatbelt sign is on just to make my son feel worse I was livid at this point and couldn't wait to get off the flight When leaving the flight none of the crew said goodbye or smiled which was ridiculous I have worked in customer service my entire life and no matter what is going on this is not acceptable", "Puerto Rico to Austin I flew for the first time on JetBlue and it will probably be the last time Almost all my flights were delayed for over an hour and I had to spend a night in Fort Lauderdale because I missed my connecting flight due to the delay of two hours Thankfully they gave me a ticket for the next day and a place to stay but the next day the flight was also delayed My returning flight was again delayed for an hour so I had a layover of five hours I can definatly say this has not been the most pleasant vacation experience", "Westchester to Orlando Horrible customer service Inconsistent policies for checking bags Actually split up a party allowing one to get on the plane and one because of the 90 minute window to check a bag Wouldn't even try to help resolve issue and rude on top of it I'm a frequent traveler to Orlando for work and used to swear by JetBlue I think I just took my last flight with them Customer service over the last year has significantly decreased", "Ft Lauderdale to Port Au Prince Completely traumatizing experience checking in to boarding the Airplane was a horrible experience the attendant were very rude This was my first and only time Traveling jetblue I paid 497 For horrible customer service While sitting on airplane I get an email that my flight was also delayed", "New York to New Orleans Will never fly again Multiple delays with no updates App does not work Boarding pass does not work Had to re print boarding pass at gate No overhead space", "Orlando to Newark Departing flight was 3 hours late Didn't get to destination until after 2 00 am Major inconvenience for relative having to stay up to pick us up from Airport Returning flight again delayed Didn't get home until after 2 00 am Had to pay for extra day of parking We couldn't go to work next day Jet blue offer NO compensation Claims delays were weather related totally untrue Jetblue ruined my much anticipated trip Will never fly Jetblue again", "Fort Lauderdale to New York JFK on July 31st 2019 The flight was scheduled to depart FLL at 8 32 PM EST and arrive at JFK at roughly 11 36 PM During the morning on that day I went online to check the status of the flight To my surprise I found out the flight was delayed for nearly three hours It now read that the flight was scheduled to depart at 11 10 PM and arrive at 2 07 AM I was shocked at how long this delay and attempted to find out the reason why However the Jetblue website was unclear in explaining why This was urgent because I had a connecting international flight out of JFK from a different airline that was scheduled to depart on time at 2 30 AM Because of this situation I figured I would get to the airport early so I could maybe get on an earlier flight to New York When I arrived at FLL I went towards the Jetblue customer service desk After over 40 minutes of standing in line I was finally able to talk to a customer service representative I explained to the representative my entire situation and he said he would try to see what he can do After 20 minutes of searching on his computer he said that he could get me on an 8 30 PM Jetblue flight to New York was also delayed and originally scheduled to leave at 2 00 PM I asked if there were seat available and he said there were I was hopeful for a few moments but that ended when he stopped talking and went on his phone After some time he seemed to make a call but never actually said anything on the phone After over an hour he finally told us that this flight that would have saved my entire situation was completely sold out I had no idea when it was sold out or why it wasn't sold out when the representative told me he could get me seats on it I asked him if there was anything else that was available and he just said no I asked him what the reason was for the delay and he said there were thunderstorms in NY causing all flights to NY to get held back At this point I was frustrated as I could have used another airline to buy a ticket to NYC instead of wasting my time with Jetblue customer service However it was too late and it appeared that all other flights to NYC and Newark that would have fit my time frame were unavailable I looked at the departure screen and noticed only Jetblue flights to every destination were delayed No other airline had delayed flights I also called my family in NYC and they said there were no thunder or rain there I decided to just wait for my original flight At around 11 PM it was announced that the flight was delayed to 11 30 because there was no pilot for the plane After 40 minutes we were finally able to board the plane After arriving in JFK I had to reschedule my connecting flight as it already left They explained I must get a confirmation from Jetblue that my flight was indeed delayed However the JFK Jetblue customer service refused information for anything delayed One of the staff outright said We can't give any information about delayed flights and claimed I was threatening him when I argued it was the other airline that requested the delay confirmation He began walking towards me closely in an attempt to push me away form the help desk Worst customer service ever no transparency or honesty rude and confrontational employees I will never fly jetblue again", "Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale This was my first time flying JetBlue and although the plane had some serious signs of wear and tear the flight experience was pleasant The front seat reclined the free snacks entertainment drinks and Wi Fi were a plus I wish JetBlue would consider doing rows of two seats and charging more for a bigger seat Like Spirit does with the Big Front Seat JetBlue is the only four star airline we have in the USA and it shows You get a lot for what you pay and the experience on the ground and in the air is very pleasant Good job JetBlue I look forward to flying with you again", "Oakland to Long Beach Up until this flight I was a loyal JetBlue customer No more After boarding the flight and having us sit around for an hour so they disembarked us and said there was a simple sensor that needed to be fixed On an hourly basis they said the problem was going to be resolved The 10 58 am flight finally took off at 8 30 pm The level of either incompetence or of deception was extraordinary even in these days where poor performance is expected It was as if the airline did not want us to cancel and switch to another airline irrespective of the inconvenience to the passenger Everyone involved in this clear deception did so with a pleasant smile on their face which leads me to conclude the reason for the delay was incompetence rather than deception We finally decide to pay for a very expensive last minute ticket to an alternate airport that was closer to our destination Now catch this Even though a 250 payment was promised per the passenger bill of rights since we were delayed over 8 hours if you cancelled your reservation even at the last minute to get on an alternate flight you would lose the payment So we got a new ticket but did not cancel the old ticket since the payment would exceed the ticket cost We have had several severe delays on JetBlue recently The latest 8 hours to fix a sensor was the last straw Clearly this is a severe management problem Maintenance is not up to the challenge of flying the heck out of these planes and clearly the airport staff has not been taught how to value customers and treat them honestly Goodbye JetBlue you were a good friend but have lost your way", "When I boarded my flight everything seemed fine until the pilot reported a 7 and half hour delay which turned in to a 12 hour delay then cancelation We boarded and deplaned my flight 224 out of LAX to JFK twice The cancellation was not made official so I could not change my flight online The line to service help was extremely long and I could not get through to anyone on the phone for over an hour I risked getting offline to go to a gate in order to get out on standby for a flight leaving the same night I could not leave the airport so I have to get my checked bag mailed to me whenever if ever they find it I understand delays happen all of the time however this situation was very poorly managed by the instructed means from the staff Once I reached JFK I received and email notifying me of my flight change from Burbank a completely different airport in LA which would leave the next night and get me back to JFK two days later I was in LAX from 6 am through 6pm due to delays and did not reach JFK until 2am the next morning up almost 24 hours at that point To make matters worse flights that took off after my flight flew to JFK just fine Even other delayed flights left before my flight was even unofficially canceled I don't know why my flight was so disastrous but not officially canceling my flight at all really screwed me over Please do better", "I was flying from Raleigh to Boston and had a connected flight to Dubai However our flight was delayed for about 2 hours and the staff were unsure as to what the cause was for the delay The ground staff was very rude and and did not give us any explanation for the delay I tried asking them about what will happen if I miss the flight to Dubai but they were not answering even though Jetblue is associated with the Emirates flight I was going to go in Overall the day was very stressful and the uncooperating staff did not make it any easier", "On July 10 2019 I had to fly to the Dominican Republic with my husband and two daughters We went to the airport on time for our flight at 7 00 a m There was a problem so we could not arrive on that flight but rather a different flight that night at 9 00 p m We were pretty lost at the airport and didn't quite know where we were going until we asked to speak to the supervisor He Tom didn't just help us get our way through the airport and get us where we needed to be he gave us first class tickets a comfortable flight with a new aircraft he gave us flight credit and free luggage I had a great experience with Jet Blue Airways and had a safe flight to and from the Dominican Republic I understand sometimes negative situations happen on the way but that doesn't mean Jet Blue is the worst airline I will always fly with Jet blue Thank you", "New York to Kingston So firstly my flight delayed four hours without us being informed I booked five tickets together including one infant and a toddler JetBlue places the toddler 5 to sit by herself three rows from us We informed them that's ridiculous and if anyone should be placed to sit alone it should be one of the adults They refused to change it When we got on the plane the dad went to sit with the toddler Flight attendant came and told him to move and he said no my toddler will not sit alone She stated that she don't know why they upgraded our seats and she is going to put us off the plane", "Meet and Assist Services offered through JetBlue Failure On July 20 our kids 15 and 13 took a flight to Newark New Jersey from MCO Orlando On July 20 our kids 15 and 13 took a flight to Newark New Jersey from MCO Orlando They were set up for the Meet and Assist service that JetBlue offers as a courtesy My husband and I were able to get tickets to take them to the boarding gates Upon getting them on the plane One of the JetBlue crew members assured us that he would be the one that would assist them getting them to and adult that was picking them up Once they got off the plane in a whole other state the kids waited 15 minutes and no one assisted them or came up to them from jetblue They eventually navigated themselves to the arrival terminal pick up outside where their Aunt met up with them Thank God she on the phone with them the whole time Long story short flight back home Again No Meet and Assist services although they had the slips for it in hand both ways", "Las Vegas to Long Beach Worst flight and customer service I have experienced After my flight being delayed 3 times and a gate change I finally boarded Driving around for over an hour the pilot decided we are unable to take off we sit there in the plane with no air conditioning or no idea on what is happening for another 30 minutes to be told we are unable to fly No refund is offered only the option of waiting 2 hours for a possibility of another flight at 11 45 midnight when asking the flight attendant if I'm able to cancel my flight and get my baggage they wouldn't allow It they told me I have to collect them in Long Beach as they were not unpacking the luggage from the aircraft This stopped me from any chance of catching another flight thanks to JetBlue I missed my ride from longbeach to Lax for my connecting flight home to Australia Will never be flying with this airline again if I could give minus 10 stars I would", "Portland to Anchorage I was flying back home with a group of friends We were all sitting next to one another As I was standing in line to board they called me up to the front desk Once there a man handed me a new boarding pass with a new seat assignment in the very back of the plane second to last row He told me the reasoning was because two people wanted to sit next to each other Why those two people matter more than my friend and I I do not know Very frustrating as most people were already on the plane and thus I didn't feel like I had time to try and possibly get a new seat near my friends Since I have already gone through the process of writing the review I figured I'd add my flight down as well Everything on the way down was great except for the flight attendants They were among the worst I've encountered while flying They were rude to me as well as other passengers I've always flown Alaska Airlines but my friends and I decided to fly Jet Blue this time because the tickets were cheaper Now I recognize Alaska Airlines is worth the extra money", "Boston to Philadelphia First and last time flying jet blue I volunteered to check my carry on in Aruba since there was no storage space I was to connect with a flight in Boston at 9 25 to take me to Philadelphia at 10 55 I was told there were mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane from Raleigh landing about 11 At this point my parking pass expires and my car was at risk of being towed I begged the parking for an extension until 1 am so I was anxious about that We boarded and proceeded to sit for another 30 min for a computer issue We finally took off and landed around 12 30 and my luggage went missing I had to get to my car and drive 90 min to home so jet blue said they will deliver my bag I returned home at 3 am and my bag 11 00 pm the next day JetBlue offered me a useless 50 credit to be used within a year I will never use them again so what would I do with a credit Never again", "Ft Lauderdale to Raleigh Durham Delayed 7 times got to connection delayed 2 twice after missing connection terrible airline I refuse to ever ride again Sloppy cabin terrible customer service don't use", "New York to New Orleans This is the second time we have used JetBlue and it was spot on again Flight was on time cabin crew nice seats comfortable and plenty of legroom great for me as I'm 6'3 the complimentary drinks snacks were a nice touch Overall a great flight No hesitation in recommending JetBlue", "Boston to Dallas After the terrible experience with JetBlue today I will never fly jet blue again and I fly most weeks and this is the first time I've ever been unable to simply print a boarding pass because I was not a full hour early Since I was carry on TSA pre check and saw it would only take a couple of minutes I get the attention of one of the workers to tell them I still have plenty of time just need a pass but instead he tells me to get in the line of people checking bags etc and they will just need to rebook you I then get in line still think there is a chance as I am about the 7th person and watch the workers spend as much time talking to each other as calling the next customer When I finally get up I get the lecture on being an hour early and am told they will replace my 6 49 am flight with a 2 15 pm flight causing me to miss an important lunch meeting As she is finishing I overhear the worker at the next station giving the same 1 hour lecture to the next customer over Anyone on in the us who flies any other airline with tsa pre clear and no bags to check is used to having no issue 45 or 55 minutes out unless TSA preclear has a backlog After all that I breeze through TSA in about 2 minutes go to the flight for my 2 15 pm flight and notice I'm still there almost 15 minutes before my original flight was scheduled so having more than 7 hours to kill because of jetblues awful process I walk across the terminal to find the flight is closed though no it yet taking off and that they did actually call my name at the gate and held in case I showed up The lady at that gate was very nice and apologetic It appears Delta can book me last minute on another flight for points and get me in 5 hours earlier so I will certainly advise everyone to book with anyone but JetBlue", "La Guardia to Orlando Originally scheduled to leave from SWF at 5 30pm Arrived to airport at 2pm and then it begins Delayed another delay and another delay It went from 5 30 to

at 12 26am From 2pm I've been traveling This is it I'm done with Jetblue They have turned from one of the best to the worst I would recommend to anyone you get what you pay for Then I'm told because I have a JetBlue Credit Card I wouldn't have to pay for my first checked bag but it has to be a certain Jetblue card not mine Paid extra for LegRoom plus the cost of the air fare Being told delay was due to weather thunderstorm in the area Yet we didn't see a cloud in the sky If I could give a rating less then zero I would And just in case this ain't the first time So my frustration has been building", "New York to Cancun Traveling with my family to Mexico JetBlue initially did not allow us to select seats due to over boarding In order to sit with my family we purchased upgraded extra room seats at 60 a seat When we arrived at the gate to board with my son traveling with disabilities including major anxiety The gate agents then proceeded to refuse us early boarding despite all three members in the emergency row which we paid 180 to be sitting in being over 18 legally they have to be over 15 because we had a minor in a different row We were then left on the side while they boarded the plane and began to cause my son massive anxiety and he broke down in tears at the gate They jet blue agents sold us seats at outages mark ups to avoid a situation like this only to cause an even worse fiasco Absolutely unacceptable and a terrible way to begin our vacation", "Atlanta to Boston This is literally the second time JetBlue has saved my trip Both times I've had cancelled flights and the other airlines refused to help me find a quick and easy way home I'm pregnant so staying at an airport or hotel isn't great so the less time spent the better JetBlue has flights leaving to Boston first thing in the morning and I've been able to catch them with no issue The staff have always been so understanding and helpful Thanks for getting this lady home when she needs it", "Boston to New York JFK For this flight I was traveling solo and had a connecting flight at JFK to an international destination Unfortunately yet again my Jetblue flight was delayed and this time we left about 2 hours and 30 minutes behind schedule It seems that while our plane was already at the gate we needed a particular pair of pilots to be present and they were still stuck flying another plane into Boston before flying ours onward to New York After flying several times with Jetblue over the course of a month I think I can safely say this airline has some pretty serious aircraft operational issues which need to be worked out Once again everyone I interacted with both on the ground and in the air was wonderful I must give real kudos to the gate staff who managed to get everyone onto the airplane in a matter of a few minutes once the pilots had arrived for our flight In addition to this the flight attendants ensured that all beverages and all snacks were available during this flight This would already be an achievement for a flight of this short duration but it was even more impressive considering that the pilots managed to fly us to New York about 15 minutes faster than usual Kudos to them as well So while our flight did arrive 2 hours late into JFK and would have meant my missing my connecting flight if it had not been for my connecting flight's mysteriously being rescheduled to 2 hours later as of a week in advance I cannot in good conscience give the people involved in this flight a bad rating They truly did everything humanly possible to rectify a terrible situation and I am grateful to them as I hope other passengers were too But that said on the operations side Jetblue really needs to get their act together I've seen too many delays for their flights by this point to think it's a rarity and people really do have places they need to get to on time", "New York JFK to Boston Our flight ended up leaving JFK about 35 minutes late It appeared to have something to do with aircraft operational issues The good news is we did seem to make up for some of the lost time on the tarmacs in New York and Boston and we ended up arriving at the gate in Boston only about 20 minutes late This wasn't a big deal for my family in particular but I could tell that this was a big deal for some other passengers who had connecting flights and who bolted off of the plane as soon as we had arrived at the gate in Boston During the flight once again all beverages were available but only cookies and Cheez Its were available as snacks I have noticed that while in the past they offered only either water or Coke as beverages during this flight they have expanded the beverage options While I do appreciate this I think I would have more greatly appreciated their offering all of the snacks instead of all of the beverages as I always get excited for the blue potato chips on Jetblue flights I think offering more snack options instead of more beverage options would probably also be easier for the flight attendants to manage than the current situation where it seems they are really pressed for time given the short duration of this flight The flight attendants work very hard They are also always pleasant Also the individual TV screens worked during this flight which was nice A very good experience overall", "Rochester NY to New York City NY JFK with Jetblue Airways Unfortunately my family's experience for this flight was not nearly as good as for the flight I previously reviewed from Boston to Rochester Our flight ultimately left Rochester about two hours late seemingly due to weather related issues The TV screens on our plane were not functional during this flight While all beverages were available snacks available were limited to either cookies or Cheez Its I'd like to give a shout out however to the flight attendants during this flight as they managed the service well and were accommodating with beverages despite some pockets of turbulence along the way The flight took the expected time and we arrived at JFK about two hours late", "Cleveland to Turks and Caicos via Ft Lauderdale Terrible customer service This is a turning point for the company they either put their customers first or they won't be in service any longer period I would love to help this company become successful wish they would hear me out", "Punta Cana to New York Staff on board had a sour look as soon as we entered My older friend was struggling with her carry on and in a curt voice the flight attendant told her it can't fit Struggling to move it the other compartment she chided her for not leaving it where it was not even offering to assist The crew was so unfriendly that I was afraid to ask for more water The first experience with miserable staff please educate them to be polite to consumers", "We were supposed to fly from Hartford CT to San Jose Costa Rica through Fort Lauderdale FLL Our flight from Hartford to FLL was delayed due to both mechanical and weather issues by over three hours which as a result would make us miss our connecting flight from FLL to Costa Rica JetBlue had to move us to a flight to the following day making us miss a whole day of our vacation Apparently JetBlue has no agreements with any other airlines when it comes to accommodating their customers to try to find other available flight options According to JetBlue rules passengers are entitled to 250 credit when their flights are delayed for more than 6 hours when unrelated to weather Our flight was delayed by 24 hours due to both mechanical and weather conditions however JetBlue refused to compensate because they are blaming the weather only even though I have an official JetBlue email stating both mechanical and weather being the cause of the delay After a big fight on the phone without any apology but rather being told that we were not even charged extra finally got 75 per person credit to be used within a year JetBlue also does not reimburse its customers for hotel stays due to delayed flights", "Absolutely horrendous customer service in Orlando and JetBlue shame on you for allowing your paying customers to sit in the airport for 8hours due to delay after delay and for what you all said was due to the air planes being used to many time Why would you book if you cannot manage that many flights", "Our flight to JFK was delayed by about a half hour We had a short connection in JFK with a different airline so we were concerned that we would not make our connection We talked to the staff on the flight about our situation and they made a special announcement as we were landing asking everyone that if they did not have to rush to make a connecting flight to please remain seated until those who did our family exited the plane It was super nice of them Because of them asking that we made our connecting flight by a miracle I was very happy with the service of Jetblue", "Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta with Jetblue Airways My granddaughter traveled and I was charged 100 each way for her to be escorted They did nothing except put her in her seat The family took her to the plane and stayed until it took off The family picked her up at the door of the plane when it arrived When I complained they said the flight attendant was watching her Give me a break", "Boston to Rochester In the past my parents and I have tried traveling from Boston to Rochester on American Airlines and in most cases American Airlines failed actually to get us to Rochester This time I encouraged my parents to book us tickets on JetBlue instead now that they are offering this route What a difference Our experience for this route on JetBlue was so much better than American Our plane departed Boston and arrived in Rochester on time We were offered the full spectrum of available snacks and drinks The personal IFE monitors were functional The flight attendants were great too All around it was an excellent experience", "Ft Lauderdale to San Francisco Awfully bad experience I travelled from FLL to SFO with my family 1 Jet Blue prices grow much faster than other companies when you add just the basic option in my case it was 50 that puts this company to the same category with American Airlines United etc 2 For this price you have service that is worse than the appropriate low cost one In FLL the terminal where Jet Blue operates is far away from the rental cars parking comparing to United that operates in the same terminal And even if Jet Blue tails and admits it you can't get anything no business lounge no paid hotels absolutely nothing 3 I came to the terminal and printed the boarding passes one hour prior to the takeoff But the infrastructure in the airport that works for Jet Blue is so awfully bad that I missed the flight The system doesn't print tags for luggage and nobody assists passengers Finally after a few attempts we came to the service desk to print them it was 50 minutes prior to takeoff Then we spent over 20 minutes printing the tags it's easy to see the timestamps on the tags Finally they didn't give us all our tags one was missing People were extremely slow then there was a glitch in the software then the printer didn't work Finally 25 minutes prior to takeoff we came to the security check where we supposed to have a separate line We didn't get it even after we told that we're missing the flight The gate was closed strictly on time and we had to go to the Jet Blue service desk 4 People at the desk saw right from the beginning all our statuses in the system and agreed that the was no our fault in this situation They were not able to offer anything earlier than in 24 hours but helped to identify all our luggage tags numbers and initiated the refund appreciate it however I haven't got it so far Everything else became our problem 5 We tried to discuss the situation with the manager on site but this step was absolutely useless We were waiting for him for 40 minutes a family of five people including a five year old child that already supposed to be sleeping on the plane He told us that he's sorry about what happened but didn't offer anything to compensate our losses time and money for the tickets that we had to buy in the last minute and hotel He didn't say anything regarding the enormous timeslots for the typical operations that we saw His point was that even if passengers paid for some services to get faster to the gate one hour is not enough and we had to come earlier But passengers should be notified about these critical issues in advance and have clear recommendations And it doesn't mean that airlines are free from any obligations to support passengers on site Nobody notified me that I had to plan 30 35 for each operation I would never go for it Overall conclusion No way Doesn't make sense to pay for the service if you can't get it We had many examples of good and bad services but this one is the worst experience that we had All companies have problems but this time were had no support at all In case of any troubles with Jet Blue you have reasons and explanation but no help They can tell you who's fault it is but they can't provide you anything after that happened Special attitude exists only in their slogans The worst example of low cost with the prices of genuine airlines", "Syracuse to Orlando We have flown with JetBlue airways for years and usually have received adequate service This year we received an email just 6 1 2 hours before our departure from Syracuse NY informing us that the flight #655 had been canceled with no explanation as to why After further inquiry we were told 2 things bad weather did not allow the aircraft to be sent north from Orlando the day previous to the scheduled departure date and JetBlue did not have a pilot available to fly the aircraft north from Orlando Imagine that Honestly I think they just made up any old excuse Regardless I received an email 20 minutes later approximately 6 hrs before scheduled departure time stating that they rescheduled our flight for 2 days later Now there's a genius answer to their problem Our family spent over 10 000 for a 2 week vacation to Florida only to have an airline cut the vacation short by 2 days because of their total screw up Wow Needless to say we were not able to find any flights for 5 passengers and had to drive from Syracuse NY to Orlando FL No big deal it's only an 18 hour drive Bottom line I'm not sure who within JetBlue made this decision but this experience for him her is disgraceful in my opinion The airline probably has just lost the trust of hundreds of potential customers because of your ingenious decision", "Boston to Raleigh We had a mechanical difficulty with the plane we were on causing us to deplane I thought it would take forever to schedule another flight but Jetblue had us on another plane within an hour It was amazing and very courteous staff that turned a possible flight nightmare to a very well planned departure for the circumstances", "New York to Charlotte I've been a loyal jetblue customer for over a decade and they 'were' always my go to airline This changed on this flight from JFK to Charlotte that was delayed 6 hours Now we all know delays are possible and when they are based on weather or things not in an airlines control you learn to deal with it However our actual plane was right there at JFK but it first had to take a plane load of people to Nantucket which apparently had a ground stop The delay for that route went from 30 minutes to an hour 2 hours 3 hours 4 hours 5 hours You see instead of just cancelling the Nantucket flight and taking the us to Charlotte we had to wait for that other flight on the plane we needed Now considering this is their main hub there has to be an extra plane and pilots I'm told by someone in the industry that is typical But let's put that aside weather was good at JFK and weather was good in Charlotte the issue is with an unrelated route which we now had to wait 6 hours When you take the 6 hour wait arriving at the airport an hour early and the 2 hour flight I essentially could have driven to Charlotte faster Now consider their useless Jetblue 'Bill of Rights' since the ground stop was in Nantucket I was exempt from any money So basically Jetblue will never give you money back they will blame anything and anyone for their awful service I contacted customer service who are useless asked for a supervisor who after an hour gave up I finally just emailed a list of execs at Jetblue and did get a useless response that did not address their issues Jetblue used to be a good airline if you have options you may want to think about the fact your flight could be delayed by some other plane which in the case of my return flight was on the other side of the country", "Ft Lauderdale to Holguin Worst experience and worst customer service At the counter the representative that was taking care of me was very rude unprofessional she hidden her name tag Didn't want to process my family tickets together even though I was paying with same credit card She even sent me back to the line and started helping another customer Staff was very rude even the supervisor No solution Worst airline to travel Never traveling with Jetblue", "Portland to Boston We were in Portland Oregon Had boarded and were then told we had to deplane There was 'a crack on the engine exhaust' Who knows what would have happened if we tried to make it to Boston but I sincerely appreciate their putting our safety ahead of our desire to reach our destination We were in the airport for about ten hours They brought in pizza and burgers and a food cart with snacks They constantly apologized but my husband and I were like 'Why You were looking out for our safety ' We love JetBlue and will book with them whenever we can", "Fort Lauderdale to New York Complete disappointment TSA pre check was not on boarding pass Our carry on luggage was checked in Thank you very much but if you monitor passenger overhead suitcase use I would not have to be inconvenienced Movies not available No compensation for their lack of responsibility to their passengers Bye bye JetBlue Looking for a more reliable airline", "Phoenix to Ft Lauderdale By far the worst travel experience I've ever had I get being a cheap airline means I'm not going to get the same customer service but everyone I spoke to in Ft Lauderdale was rude and dismissive I equate it to being as bad as Frontier but more condescending I also spoke to someone on the phone and she was just as bad Just pay the extra for added peace of mind", "Buffalo to Atlanta via Boston Delayed flight in Buffalo NY so missed connecting flight in Boston and had to stay the night Next morning flight left on time but arrived 2 5 hours late so missed the noon connecting flight They put us in the next flight at 4pm the doors have been closed on the plane for an hour twenty and we still haven't moved I'm hating Jet Blue Make that an hour forty without moving", "24 hours flight delayed from Quito to Fort Lauderdale delayed on all my connecting flights I'm still stuck in Boston Have been traveling for more than 24 hours already I won't purchase tickets from JetBlue again and definitely don't recommend anybody to use this airline", "Reno to Long Beach Had hope this airline would prove me wrong but sadly couldn't be more disappointed Planned for this trip 6 month's ago just for them to cancel my flight because the plane was missing pieces Never flying through this airline again", "Boston to Medellin return via Fort Lauderdale All 4 flights were delayed by an hour or more the last flight was 3 hour delay I have flown Jetblue a number of times this trip by far is the worst with them On June 18 flight to Boston the plane sat loaded waiting to take off of an hour excuse bad weather yes it was overcast but I have taken off and landed at FLL in heavy weather before I will say the flight crew was great on each leg of the tri communication could have been better by terminal staff in Medellin self check in terminals worked for some and not for others including me in Feb it worked fine needless to say greatly disappointed this time with Jetblue", "Atlanta to New York This review is on the booking process rather than the actual flight I have always loved JetBlue but today my opinion changed In February I booked a flight for my sister in law to fly from ATL to JFK and returning to ATL Today I went onto the JetBlue website to try to get a better seat and make final touch up since she needs wheelchair assist etc On seat selection I was offered a wonderful seat in first row 1A with plenty leg room so I paid extra 42 from the ATL JFK leg and 50 for the JFK ATL leg I was not able to ask for special accommodations and I noticed that luggage was not included what But I have no way to pay for luggage So I opened up a chat window and a lady came on to help She said I can add luggage and pay the fee on check in I explained this is an 82 year old traveler and I want to make sure she is all set but with all the technology JetBlue was not able to help me pay for this old lady luggage I fail to understand from a programming point of view if I can pay for a better seat and the system can take credit cards why can't I pay for luggage Very disappointed wont fly JetBlue again", "Buffalo to Fort Lauderdale Very disappointed with JetBlue assigning different seats to My wife and I and not able to change seats just because the airline want to charge for the seat Never will use this airline again", "Newark to Boston Late all because of lack of personnel 5 hour delay and counting for a connecting flight to Chicago all based on a policy of needing 2 attendants on each flight No back up employees at the airport", "Worst service staff members They are rude unproffesional disrespectful No sensibility empathy or consideration with customers that need help Don't offer suggestions to solve problems or make the experience less stressful Making the customers life into a nightmare by taking forever to find a supervisor or a translator for people with language barriers in needs", "New York to Punta Cana I have been a loyal customer since 2011 This past two trips have been a nightmare Their service agent at JFK was not very knowledgeable had a short fuse was rude to several passengers and just seemed very angry I tried to go to another agent but it seemed they all had a chip on their shoulder and where not very helpful The JetBlue terminal HVAC system was not working and we could not wait to get onboard Once onboard we thought that the nightmare was over How wrong I was The plane had engine problems and were directed to go back to JFK Once their we were given these snack boxes that really were not very appealing Not to mention the HVAC still has not been fixed So the hours past 7 hours in total in the sweltering heat of JFK JetBlue terminal Finally they found a pilot to fly the airplane The stewardess on the plane where OK But not the way I'm used to JetBlue I understand that issues happen but their employees were downright mean and unhelpful throughout the entire ordeal As a loyal customer with 100's of thousands worth of points I can honestly say that I will be giving another airline a try for the first time Flight 369 June 5", "Orlando to Montego Bay I wanted to take 3 bags on carry on they said it was full and I had to pay 130 for all bags to be checked In Then our plane was delayed over an hour and a half and right before we switched terminals 3 times they offered everyone in front of me to check their bag below the plane for free cause the carry on was full So I called to Jetblue and the person was rude and didn't care I waited a few days and I called back again and spoke to a pleasant person and I told her I didn't want to get mad but I would like a refund for the 90 of the 3 carry on's I had She spoke to her supervisor and they offered me a credit of 130 but I don't travel often and I had 364 days to use it I asked again for my 90 refund and the supervisor only gave me a half refund", "Absolutely terrible organization Flight got delayed which I understand What I don't understand is how you have to sit on the plan an extra hour after the delay with no information And then wait an hour plus on the plane when we land to get off Literally have been sitting on this plane for 2 5 hours with everyone on board for no explainable reason Terrible", "Boston to San Francisco Gate agents were overzealous in enforcing the carrying bags I was carrying 2 bags and a paper bag that was 1 inch thick and 4 inches tall which I could have placed in my jacket pocket and was told that I had to check it in or one of my other bags I understand the two bag policy however that's what I call splitting hairs which leaves a bad taste for JetBlue Airlines I can now understand why JetBlue only has a three star rating The service by the gate agents needs to be improved", "Chicago to Boston I have had the worse experiences with JetBlue lately Today was the final straw when they didn't load my bag and they don't have enough people to find out where it is Flights are delayed and not because of weather They have definitely gone downhill in the last year or so", "Newark to Ft Lauderdale JetBlue has to be the worst airline I have flown Been a member since 2013 for the past two or three years my work schedule has been destroyed because of their delays constant excuses for the delay My flight was scheduled for 5 00 pm Now it's 12 02am the next day Sat in the airport for 6 hours Constant lying about the reasons for delay Their fleet is short servicing the number of people flying It may be true for other airlines But my wife has no issues with United Airlines Always fly on time Sad about JetBlue", "Ft Lauderdale to Atlanta Worst customer service experienced They closed the doors as we approached the gate and told us to reschedule Then she opened the door for the pilots and repeated for us to reschedule tho the plane hadn't taken off We watched this worker close the door in our face Next flight wasn't until 9 hours later Flight attendants were rude in the oncoming flights I will never recommended or book this Arline again Delta or southwest all the way In flight entertainment did not work now did our previous flight have snacks", "San Juan to Fort Lauderdale Super bad service My flight got delayed 4 times with different excuses Me and my family got to the airport at 1 00 am to catch our flight that was supposed to departure at 3 40 am and was not able to leave until 10 45 am My kids and other kids were sleeping on the floor and all they had for us was some sandwiches and a bunch of excuses We always use Southwest and after this experience we will keep doing it", "Philadelphia to Boston I have flown JetBlue exclusively due to service but will no longer fly with them My recent flight was nearly 3 hrs delayed Moreover my bag checked was severely damaged during flight The pull handle completely snapped off The bag is relatively new and excellent quality Victorinox JetBlue would not replace the bag and merely offered a 200 flight credit which expires in 1 year I do not anticipate taking a flight within the next year so this credit is completely useless Meanwhile I will need to shell out 400 to replace my suitcase Terrible customer service", "Long Beach to Salt Lake City My 4 year year old daughter and I were traveling home from a vacation in Long Beach Somehow JetBlue gave away my daughter's seat so we were forced to wait in the airport for over 4 hours for another flight The worst part is that Jetblue continued to indicate that I should have saved out boarding passes to my wallet on iPhone They maintained this not their fault and that I should be thankful they could book us on a later flight at all Being separated from the rest of our party having my daughter cry because she was separated from our nanny spending 4 extra hours in an airport was frustrating enough but to have customer service agents repeatedly be condescending and rude was too much", "Fort Lauderdale to Newark This airline allows the rear of the plane to board first and allows this passengers to put carry on luggage in the front cabinets This prevents others from having room for their carry on pieces and causes them to put their pieces in the back of the plane Why not load front to back or keep cabinet doors closed to those passengers in the back preventing them from using the front cabinets This is completely inconvenient and poorly managed", "Phoenix to Boston I was sold tickets for specific seats I have confirmations from JetBlue via email Instead of the seats together that I purchased on the confirmation we were moved to middle seats and my girlfriend and I were separated with horrible customer service when I inquired Will never fly this airline again", "Boston to West Palm Beach I flew up to Boston on Spirit I thought that was the worst of my trip however there was no charge for my emotional support dog to accompany me with Spirit then I used JetBlue for my trip back home The attendant at the counter told me I had to go over to another counter for my dog to board but didn't tell me he needed to have his bag His bag was in my check in bag So I went over to the other counter where I was told that he needed his bag so they called to have my check in bag sent to the customer service desk one flight below the ticket counter I had an emotional support dog with me and his certificate shot record and special vest on him and because I didn't have the information on their forms I was charged 125 00 or that he could be put in the cargo bay with the luggage Also we were put through a separate line for security which my son and I thought would take a shorter time The TSA agents knew we were now late in getting to our gate and made it impossible to get quickly thru the screening and we missed our flight So we had to re book to the next flight leaving Then when landing I was told that my emotional support dog had to be put back down into his bag Since he is an emotional support animal I should have been allowed to keep him with me on my lap People with babies hold them on their lap they aren't told the baby can't stay on their lap The airline had changed the way they handle support dogs last year I hadn't used JetBlue in years nor will I ever fly with them again I should receive my 125 00 back with an apology from this company for the way I was treated with my dog I am 65 year senior citizen I should not have been treated this way by the airline I will never fly nor will I recommend anyone I know ever to fly JetBlue", "Austin to Ft Lauderdale I've flown a lot with many different airlines and I've never had an overall worse experience Constant delays not only on my own flights but on others in my terminal The delays caused me to miss my connection and I was stuck in Fort Lauderdale for 24 hours No compensation for my work damages for missing a work trip Not even compensation for the hotel and cabs I had to get for the 24 hours stuck They acted like it was a miracle I could even get on a flight the next day Will not be flying with JetBlue again", "I have never flown on a jetblue flight that has not been delayed Whether it is New York Miami Charleston Aruba Boston etc they continuously push flights back with zero explanation The staff is never helpful in providing information and are often incredibly rude and dismissive I have missed several events due to their delays Other airlines remain on schedule but it seems as though jet blue does not know how to operate a business for repeat customers I would never recommend flying with them if you want to get to your destination in a reasonable time", "Our flight was delayed 6 hrs because of weather But the weather was perfect in New York and Aruba They just kept delaying no explanation Nothing offered Their policy is terrible your flight can be delayed with out any reimbursement if its coming from bad weather Perfect excuse to

yrs old and even she thought this was a horrible experience", "Fort Lauderdale to Nashville JetBlue is perhaps the worst airlines I personally have ever had the displeasure of doing business with They made the entire group wait 28 1 2 hours with little to no explanation and constant lies and misinformation No hotel vouchers no food and an overbooked flight the next day I was booked on a Friday flight at 2 PM and started receiving delays of 230 that morning After arriving to the airport they kept bumping our flight due to a flight delay elsewhere Then when the plane arrived they changed our gate we all rushed down there to find out that our pilots had left After two hours more of waiting we were told that the pilots had arrived but the weather was then too bad After six hours of waiting I decided to go home and rebook on the next flight out which was the same time the next day when the weather was to be beautiful Thank goodness I live close by and I could do this Most of the passengers had an awful time trying to get hotels in the area and of course they had to pay for them The next day I went back for the same terrible treatment I was told it was going to be an hour late before I got to the airport then after I was at the airport another mishap and the plane was out of service With no replacement We were told it would be another 3 to 5 hours of waiting I was to attend a surprise birthday party for my cousin at 6 o'clock and the plane wouldn't even be arriving until 830 so with a half an hour drive I would miss it entirely People missed weddings because of this debacle Southwest never skipped a beat and kept going through all of the weather and had no delays at all from Fort Lauderdale to Nashville I will never use JetBlue again They offered me nothing but a refund on my ticket Nothing to cover my lost rental car my hotel for two nights or the grief and embarrassment over not making it to our family gathering Never again", "Have been flying Jetblue since inception as they were the premier airlines in its category Over the last few months the airline has deteriorated rapidly From simple things such as TVs not working to old planes in fleet since inception The worst is that most flight scheduled have been either changed slightly or by hours As a business person going by a schedule to change flight times is extremely disruptive We are going to change the way we do business with this dysfunctional airline", "Puerto Plata to Boston We called JetBlue to book our seats immediately after we booked our all inclusive trip with using JetBlue as we always use them But never will again They told us that we had to wait until 24 hours before to book our seats or we would pay extra interesting This has never been the way it worked previous seeing as we take a few trips a Year And we try to fly JetBlue not anymore Of course And it seems from the reviews that JetBlue doesn't care About customer satisfaction anymore Families were scattered everywhere even 5 year olds By themselves But the worst was on our way back There were not enough seats when we went on to book 24 hours Before the flight so I chatted with this women and saved our chat for social Media Jetblue used to have great customer service This lady was not professional or helpful Said we should just go to the airport JetBlue never fully books Well we chose To pay 30 Extra each so we could get home safely in time Again family's complaining everyone split up Today I get a text from my co worker JetBlue overbooked People have to give up their seats her being one of them Never using JetBlue again Oh and your TV didn't work on both flights On the way back they rebooted so they began to work but they weren't playing the movies that were supposed to be playing So I

weeks round trip Boston Fort Lauderdale on business and finally I've had it Almost every time there's a delay and normally they're not 30 or 40 minutes no it's 1 30 to 2 hours delays Upon checking online I finally came to my conclusion about this airline on money magazine there's an article where they are placed last and it comes to delays and cancellations worse then Spirit unbelievable but true Stick with Delta yes they have delays as I have experienced but they were due to snow storms never anything else", "Los Angeles to Orlando Worst service ever I repeat worst service ever Explains weather related delays but flight at the gate for past 2 hours ready with no crew members Apparently they have no pilots or crew members to run the route The fight has changed times over 5 times from

advised that Jetblue is not honouring flight in or out of JFK and are not informing customers but simply cancelling the flight This has been the biggest disappointment thus far as my husband and I are trying to travel home for my grandfather's funeral They are not providing us with a reasonable explanation as to why this is happening and are giving us a hard time with reimbursing the money we have already spent on our round trip flight This is completely unacceptable and I advise you to think twice no three times about booking a flight with this airline Their communication is not what it should be especially when customers are already in route with their traveling plans They will take your money and not refund it when it is reasonably owed to you This is not how you conduct business at all", "Ft Myers to New York JFK So my last 4 flights with Jet blue were all delayed Ridiculous delays of over 4 hours or cancelled My brothers and sisters and I missed my mother's surprise 80th birthday party in July 2017 and now in her time of death we were delayed getting to her last Thursday and now we are trying to get home post her death and it's a 4 hours delay Completely unacceptable Completely unreliable Worst airline ever for onTime performance No compassion The employees on the ground unhelpful Simply saying all flight in and out of JFK are delayed Not what I need to hear and would have appreciated knowing that upfront Like I'm an idiot for not knowing this But a complete lie as the plane that left NY after my flight arrived pretty much on time Still waiting in the airport JetBlue Your the worst Thank for being consistently unreliable I hope your proud of yourself", "Washington to Fort Lauderdale This was the first time with Jetblue We were admittedly sceptical due to mixed reviews Check in was smooth with friendly Jetblue staff assisting The plane looked fresh with comfy seats and ample legroom Food may not have been great but not bad And not to forget proper wifi Flyfi The plane departed and arrived on time All in all a good experience", "Fort Lauderdale to Newark I have always liked this airline However this particular flight was a disaster I always book my ticket noting my Global ID number On this flight not only was my Global ID number NOT on my ticket in addition it did not designate an extra leg room seat As a result I missed out on a seat up front putting me in a window Exit seat which does not recline It would have been a nice gesture if the ticket agent had told me that fact", "My flight from Atlanta to JFK on the 23rd was canceled due to mechanical issue I missed my connection to Tel Aviv and had to fly Turkish instead of El Al My trip was for 7 days my suitcase didn't arrived till Wednesday the 27th because JetBlue set on it in Atlanta for 3 days before releasing it to Turkish Airlines I was attending a wedding and all my stuff was missing Niw I'm at JFK returning to Atlanta on JetBlue flight and we are going back to the gate for maintenance problems They ruined my trip start to finish", "I am hear to voice my experience during my flight from Boston to Phoenix I abstained from speaking to the people on the flight and the people at the front desk at the airport as I know they do not have any say as to what was happening This flight experience was poorly addressed and handled and the small 400 credit they sent in an email I do not feel is suitable compensation Due to the lack of the airline getting me back to Phoenix on time I had to miss an important meeting with my business consultant that flew in from Maryland to meet with me This cost me far more than 400 Not only that the airline did not start telling people they would put them up in a hotel until 11pm after they had us sitting on the runway for 4 hours I had already left and checked in to the Comfort Inn and Suites which they did reimburse me for after I wrote about my experience to their customer service This delay had nothing to due with weather it had to due with the poor scheduling of pilots on the plane that were ended up not being able to fly because their flight time ran out while we sat on the runway waiting for take off Absolutely horrible experience and their customer service continued to give me the same run around emails and they even had other people email me claiming they were supervisors and stating the exact same regards for my poor experience but there is nothing else they can do and they feel they have already compensated me fairly with their pathetic 400 credit", "Port of Spain to New York JFK Long story short JetBlue told me I read 8 lbs over on my bag I wanted to pay the over weight fee I was told I could not I had to pay for another checked bag I didn't have another bag to move the over 8lbs over so I was told I could not get on the plane or I could buy another flight for my bag I will never fly this airline again I reached out to customer service and they have yet to reach out to me They do not care at JetBlue", "Salt Lake City to new York JFK The flight to New York was dismal they tell you one overhead and one carry on wrong They use the overhead for storing snacks and since the plane is so small I ended up having to have my overhead case between my legs the whole time there The trip back was worse They changed the time by an hour moving it so when i got there i was told i couldn't board and had to rebook for a flight that was 8 hours later I wont ever fly Jetblue again it was such a horrible experience", "Never ever fly Jetblue Our family had to fly with them three times and all three times there was at least a 10 hour delay in which the airline refused accommodations even though they knew we were traveling with a special needs child and a 3 year old They had the most rude arrogant customer service I have ever dealt with in my entire life", "JetBlue agents at the help kiosk was rude and not helpful Hate that federal agents only look out for themselves and other fellow federal agents Was not helpful at all in seeing if I can get on another flight to my final destination since the airport I was currently at I couldnt stay at being that it wasnt a 24 7 airport Very horrible service Last time with JetBlue Why stay somewhere where you get poor treatment", "Boston to Detroit Very disappointed with this airline They have such bad baggage service the locks and zippers on my bags were broken off and I received my suitcase completely broken open with my clothes spilling out of the suitcase when I received it Would not recommend as both flights I had received

he was upset", "Punta Cana to Fort Lauderdale We have been delayed 3 separate times on our vacation each by 1 hours No explanations And now we are trying to head home and our flight is delayed 4 hours Not acceptable Going to miss our connection and get stuck spending the night someone Ridiculous", "My mother paid for a round trip ticket for her to travel from Fort Lauderdale to White Plains airport She brought all her current paperwork completed by her doctor and vet proving her dog was a service dog They allowed her to bring her dog on the plane as a service dog from Fort Lauderdale to White Plains and ensured her she would not have any issues on her return flight back home When she got to the airport for her return flight the Supervisor Anna Mane would not accept any of her paperwork and told her she can pay 125 for her dog buy a 50 kennel or she will have to get additional paperwork completed by her doctor and reschedule her trip back home this was a Sunday night so no way to resolve the paperwork issue at the time My mom is a senior citizen that has a serious medical condition that is triggered when she is under high level of anxiety or stress and it could cause her to go into the hospital Her dog does not only help prevent a medical issue but also lets her know when one is coming so she can take her medicine I tried to talk to the Supervisor and she apologized for the confusion their airline may have caused but was not willing to work with us in any way I explained we had two weeks before my mom's return flight so if they would have told us in Florida to get another form filled out by her doctor we would have without any problem Why would the paperwork be acceptable one way but rejected on the return flight two week later When I told the Supervisor she is putting my mom through unnecessary stress that could cause my mom to have a medical issue she threaten to not let me my travel without a full medical review just to be even more nasty My mom paid the extra money so she would not miss her flight but the Supervisor had a flight attendance harass her on the plane to ensure she kept her service dog in the kennel My mom has travel on jetblue plenty of times before with her service dog and never had any issues The flight attendant actually told her and the people sitting around her that my mom was trying to pass her dog as a service dog but he wasn't Her dog is a service dog and just because there was a misunderstanding that does not give them the airline staff the right to harass and embarrass her when she did provide significant proof that she does have a medical condition that requires her to have her dog with her at all times Her dog has never been put in a kennel so he was also impacted by how unprofessional the staff at JetBlue treated him and his owner I can understand the potential risk if my mom's service dog was a pit bull but my mom's service dog is 5 lbs and has a history with the airline traveling with her as a service dog We contacted the corporate office to put in a complaint on how she was treated and to get the opportunity to provide the doctor's paperwork they wanted so she could get reimbursed for what she was forced to pay and they rejected her request and did not even give her the opportunity to prove that her dog is a service dog The person sitting next to my mom on the airplane is also putting in a formal complaint on how badly my mom was treated I have always had a good experience with JetBlue but after how badly my mom was treated and they had no concern for her health I can not travel with them again The corporate office was not willing to even try to make the situation right by allowing her to prove she has a service dog to get her money back", "Boston to Ft Myers Last 4 times I have flown this route there have been issues This and last three Returning to gate after taxing out to get the rest of the baggage Really Last week flight was delayed two and one half hours with no explanation and after finally landing we waited on the tar mat for 45 minutes because there was a broken plane at our gate Again really You can't make this stuff up Oh and by the way they over booked the flight I am on now and we're trying this special offer to anyone stupid enough to answer If you would give up your seat Jet Blue will compensate you by flying you to aFort Lauderdale tomorrow during the snow storm ugh not even the right destination", "Baltimore to Boston Terrible Service Found out they delay this flight and the flight after it by three hours nearly every week The will blame this on the weather and give waiting passengers a free water and box of snacks This feels like to me more of a tactic to save money by using the same flight crew for both the three o'clock and seven o'clock flights There are so few passengers they are hemorrhaging money and they don't care about the fee passengers they sold goods to I find this despicable", "Boston to Ft Myers They left us stranded for 4 hrs before I had to cancel my flight Very unprofessional People at the terminal were rude Gave no explanation as to why the flight was delayed Just said to wait I have been a loyal customer for years We fly our employees and family on multiple trips every year I will no longer use this airline Why pay top dollar for bad service", "Flight scheduled from Syracuse to San Francisco with a layover in JFK The flight was scheduled for 9AM and was delayed 8 times We finally left at 1 18PM but my connecting flight for 2 59PM had just left the gate as we were landing At this point I was sent to the help desk to reschedule my flight which ended up being a 9 15PM flight At this point I'd already spent 8 hours in the airport and I'll be spending another 6 hours here until the next flight All of which was due a maintenance delay I returned to the help desk to ask for a food voucher which I know they'll give to people who miss their flights due to JetBlue's issues I was told they do not give out vouchers due to weather I explained to the woman that my flight was delayed in Syracuse due to JetBlue's airplane maintenance issues not the weather so she made a phone call Apparently their response to me was we don't have any food vouchers right now So what JetBlue is telling me that for spending 14 hours in the airport due to their own maintenance issues causing me to miss my flight they're too cheap to spare a measly 10 food voucher for me to feed myself just once in the meantime Let alone any other accommodations Back to Delta I go", "Orlando to Atlanta Our family of 7 flew Jet Blue home from a Disney World vacation in Orlando This was our first time flyers with Jet Blue We got a great deal and decided to try JetBlue was a dream come true airline We give it a A plus all the way The seats and legroom was much bigger the checkin was awesome baggage check no brained We loved having Dunkin Donut coffee served and loved having a great assortment of snacks offered for the trip home Free WiFi the kids watched cartoons and it kept them busy The concourse was new and not nearly as crowded in Atlanta We liked that we could already book our seats when we purchased since we were traveling with children They allowed us to board early and get settled Perfect all the way It will be our choice for the future trips", "My flight New York to Santo Domingo was supposed to depart at 10 58 am and we departed at 2 03 pm I spoke to the customer service personal and they couldn't give a reasonable explanation for the delay Everybody was waiting at the airport since 7 am", "Orlando to Baltimore JetBlue did an excellent job When I was delayed and couldn't meet my connection they offered me a direct flight to a near by airport Wonderful customer service Would fly with them again anytime", "San Jose to Boston We got to San Jose and our 10 42pm flight got bumped to 4 45am They told us there was absolutely nothing they could do for us Though we were traveling with a 2 year old And if they hadn't called us 2 hours before our flight back in November 2018 it wouldn't be as bad But messing up our flights twice in 3 months is a little ridiculous And in November we were going on a cruise and they also told us there was nothing they could do for us Jet blue is a terrible airline and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone I will never fly Jetblue again", "Buffalo to Orlando Booked through Expedia with there travel protection Had to cancel with the comfort of knowing we could When we went to use our credit we realized it was only worth half of what our total cost was Then we were seven days past the date and they wouldn't even let us use that Customer service was rude After calling each Expedia and Jet Blue multiple times we figured out it was Jetblue who wouldn't issue the credit Very frustrating but probably the reason they are said to be the worst airline They are going to scam you so make sure you read the fine print", "This is my first and last time ever flying JetBlue Thanks for ruining my honeymoon From the very beginning it has been awful and has turned into a nightmare since then and unfortunately we're not even done yet First we needed a name added to our ticket and for 5 hours were bounced back and forth between JetBlue and Expedia JetBlue repeatedly told me there was nothing they could do and then finally made the change after 5 hours of hair pulling insanity While at the airport they told us our flight was so delayed we'd miss our connection through Ft Lauderdale and rerouted is on a later flight through Boston now putting us in 3 hours later to the Bahamas Even that flight is now delayed over an hour and we land in Boston and run to the gate where a JetBlue employee immediately tells us that it's too late to board and that it was our fault we missed the plane because we've been at the airport for over an hour We spent several minutes arguing with her that we just barely arrived and ran straight to this gate but she was convinced we'd been at the airport for over an hour until she finally saw that we were right on her computer We had to go to someone else to rebook our flight and now we have yet another connection through Ft Lauderdale our original connection and we are getting into the Bahamas over 8 hours late And by the way while we were staring at the check in desk in SLC for 30 minutes waiting for them to finally figure out our ticket every other person who checked in for various other flights were also told their flights were delayed To top it off the plane was old and uncomfortable So JetBlue single handedly slashed our honeymoon by 25 because were losing the whole day and all they offer us is a cheap airport meal voucher Thanks for everything JetBlue including making my wife cry This is the worst experience I've ever had with an airline and they continue to keep messing things up so I'm stuck in Boston fully expecting to miss more flights and keep getting rerouted I'll be asking them to book me on a different airline on the way back but I expect more ridiculous excuses", "Orlando to New York City JetBlue still has it On time and pleasant Even the extra room seats aren't the most comfortable but that's the same anywhere except on some luxury airlines The only problem is that everyone brings a carry on some elephant sized and the overheads fill quickly Also probably the same with every domestic", "Baltimore to Boston First and last time with this airline For a two day trip the first flight was delayed by 4 hours the return flight by 2 hours They waited for all of us to board and only then calmly announced that there were no overhead bins empty Instead of letting the front crew know if the issue they let more people come in so there's a whole bunch of us standing there with out suitcases in our hands They then made us go back and check our luggage Ridiculous organization is an understatement Will avoid this airline whenever possible", "Flying from New York JFK to Seattle on a morning flight Since this was my first domestic flight in the USA I was suprised by JetBlue Almost everything went smooth Checkin was easy and I was approach by the staff for handling my bag The aircraft was new and very clean Legroom was more then OK and larger compared to European carriers in economy class Inflight entertaint is first class on JetBlue A wide variety in tv shows movies live television and free wifi onboard which worked surprisingly fast During the flight there were multiple rounds with free drinks and snacks and the crew was friendly In case you needed more drinks you could get it for free in the aft galley The flight was on time and landed ahead of schedule The only downside of this flight was SEA airport There was no parking spot available at the main terminal so the aircraft had to park at a remote stand somewhere far away Then ground crew couldn't attach traditional airstrairs to the aircraft because there was no room due to vehicles airport vehicles standing in the way It took at least 40 minutes before we could leave the plane Not JetBlue's fault Next time I will fly JetBlue again when flying domestic in the USA", "New York to Syracuse Flew with Jetblue Airways for the first time from JFK T5 earlier this month Check in and bag drop was painless Even more speed made the security line painless was well Flight was around an hour but service was outstanding", "Syracuse to Bridgetown via New York Do yourself a favor and never fly Jetblue in winter Outgoing leg from Syracuse to Barbados via JFK was uneventful except they transposed my last and middle names on the reservation causing a slight delay in boarding at JFK Was able to sleep more or less comfortably in regular coach seat during overnight JFK BGI leg However at 3 42 AM on morning of departure from BGI Saturday 1 19 I received an email and text that the BOS SYR leg of my return trip had been delayed 2 whole dats This was due to anticipated winter weather Winter Storm Harper how I hate these stupid names No way to reach anyone on the phone hung up after 45 minutes on hold At BGI I pleaded to be stuck there instead of frigid Boston but they could not accommodate me until Wednesday 1 23 and with a fee despite fee waiver My emailed complaints did get me a 300 credit half of total airfare Cluster on Monday 1 21 as 10 50 PM BOS SYR flight was repeatedly delayed until finally being canceled at 2 24 AM Due to numerous delayed canceled B6 flights there was a mad rush for transportation meaning no Ubers and an over an hour wait in single digit cold for cabs Despite cancellation being due to crew timeout ground staff still termed it a weather delay and offered no compensation beyond refunds My flight was then delayed to Wednesday 1 23 but I rented a car and drove home Most other major airlines were operating at least some flights from SYR and BOS during this spell of winter weather But B6 preemptively canceled ALL BOS flights no excuse for this", "New York to Las Vegas As one of the many people which flights were cancelled during a non existent snow storm in NYC I would like to express my disappointment about this absolute unnecessary cancellation policy We did not receive 1 inch of snow here in NYC and there was absolutely no reason other than missmanagement which caused this conflict While all other airlines continued to fly out Jetblue stoppend and did not offer any option for rescheduling the flight as after the holiday weekend In my case I had to cancel my entire trip which was carefully plannned without any reason Airlines should be made accountable for their mismanagement cost for not cancelling of accomendations and lost time It is rediculos that they can cancel without reason refund not even trying to solve the situation and provide an rescheduled flight within an day and continue I will warn everybody to fly with Jetblue This airline is absolutely unreliable", "Fort Lauderdale to Richmond with Jetblue Airways The airplane and ride overall were fine but there was this screen in my face playing the same commercials on a loop that was extremely annoying More like torture There was no apparent button to turn it off so I resorted to place my jacket over the screen in my face but still the screens from the other seats bothered me This is evil in my opinion Screen are ok as long as people are able to shut the off", "Detroit to Fort Lauderdale When I arrived at the airport I was not allowed to take the third bag I was told by the representative on the phone that I could if I paid 100 00 extra I checked ahead of time to be sure that it was no issue Also they did not let me pay extra for a 5lb over bag The bags all three of them were for people in need and not myself This is a very unaccommodating airline with very poor customer service and inaccurate information I'm very disappointed", "New York to Jacksonville I had to fly with my wife from JAX to JFK She had to change her last name for the ticket and Delta did it for free and in a timely manner Jetblue had us on the phone playing phone tag and we had to pay over 200 dollars to fix the ticket We used Jetblue to fly back to Jax and our seats were together before they issued us a new ticket The flight with the new tickets had us sitting separate and they want to charge us again for something we already had Guess what Delta changed our seats for free Delta gave us an emergency exit seat so I could be with my wife and it was more roomy Delta really takes care of their customers while Jetblue only cares about the money Will never use Jetblue again And I hear that a lot Should have listened I will tell everyone I know not to use Jetblue Also the flight was delayed and we arrived early with Delta Why would anyone use this airline I wish I could give zero stars", "Chicago to Fort Lauderdale Not good Went to airport at 6 00 in the morning waited for my flight delayed us until 5 30 than it said wait another hour When we were about to board again 30 more minutes delay They only had one other airplane to connect to Took them 10 hours Definitely book somewhere else", "Havana to Atlanta via Ft Lauderdale jetBlue had a delay of about 30 minutes when we left out of Atlanta and a mechanical delay of about 2 5 hours when we were leaving out of Havana They kept us informed of what was going on When we arrived in Ft Lauderdale US border control took over 90 minutes to stamp our passports The bags did make it but nobody from jetBlue was available at the baggage recheck desk so we had to make our own way out the door of Terminal 3 and over to Terminal 4 to speak with someone When we reached the counter the staff had already arranged for another flight to leave the next day and had booked a hotel for us with vouchers for meals This was nice but the lower dollar amount of the vouchers meant we had to eat cheap food The next day we took off on time Overall the staff at jetBlue were professional but there was a lack of hustle after the delayed flight arrived Havana as well as a lack of personnel with whom to speak directly outside of customs upon arrival in FLL Inflight wifi did not work on a couple of our flights and the video screens did not work on a couple of segments Overall the carrier seems sloppy", "San Diego to Boston I boarded the plane near to end of the line They told me that there was no room for my carry on As I walked to my seat there were 22 empty spots I had to go to baggage claim with an injury as they were too lazy to check if there were open available overhead space There was a space free above my seat for the whole flight Seriously if you want unhappy customers who won't come back this is the way to do it", "Great customer service from JetBlue team in Salt Lake City Traveled with special needs child and everyone was very helpful Very easy getting on plane and not stressful Also traveled with 5 year old son and he enjoyed it as

bookit We were supposed to fly out the 9th but was stuck on traffic because of weather conditions on the way and we missed our international flight to Jamaica We contacted our representative from bookit because we were told by the JetBlue employee at the airport she didn't have access to our tickets and she was locked out so she couldn't do anything We got the tickets unlocked by the bookit representative and the JetBlue employee changed our departing flight to Jamaica for the following day the 10th with no charge We were told the bookit representative had to change our returning flight home so to take care of that with them My husband and I fly out the following day the 10th and arrive in Jamaica and haven't heard from anyone about changing our departing flight home We contact bookit they call JetBlue who calls the insurance we payed an extra 300 for insurance when booking our honeymoon and no one can change our returning tickets The resort and excursions pushed everything back a day because we were missing a paid for night 350 per person plus 150 per person for the excursion When talking to JetBlue bookit and insurance the only options were to pay for new tickets plus a fee to leave on the 16th or leave the 15th and lose out on a night at the resort and an excursion I will never fly with JetBlue again because of their customer service", "Ft Lauderdale to Richmond The cabin crew was very welcoming and professional the seats weren't cramped Free WiFi and complimentary beverages and snacks were provided That's rare these days The price was fantastic as well I'll definitely choose JetBlue in the future Thank you JetBlue for a nice pleasant traveling experience Also The customer service was above and beyond I feel like JetBlue appreciated my business and it made me feel appreciated Thanks again", "Ft Lauderdale to Newark I like the flight but air hostess hospitality is not good She asked me anything to drink and I told any soda is fine She replied to me we have many soda and which soda you need specifically the tone she used hurts I thought might be that is the way they talk which I have never seen any flight The second time she came for a snack serving and she asked me Do you need a snack and I told yes She again asked me what snack you need specifically sir and I asked what are the snack you have She told with bold tone it is already announced in the flight sir don't you hear and later she said Chips Pretzel etc I told Chips I am saying she is not doing the service to passenger instead just the duty", "Extremely unprofessional and poorly trained staff The departing time on the itinerary was different to the one on the boarding pass we never received a notification and due to this we missed our flight Not only were we provided with wrongful information without any flight time change updates but staff tried to convince me and my girlfriend that we were at fault Claiming they could not do anything for us We expressed we were not from New York and basically had nowhere to go the response was I'm sorry but there is nothing I can do for you We decided to talk to the manager on duty she allowed one of the representatives to be rude to us and basically gave us the same response All JetBlue did for us was provide us with a flight for the following day and after spending all day out keeping ourselves busy and coming back to spend the night at the airport JetBlue said we had to come back the day the flight was departing meaning we were not allowed to spend the night at the airport", "Hartford to Tampa This is the most unprofessional airline I would rather pay twice the amount for a ticket then fly with this airline ever again I have 2 small kids all out seats were scrambled I checked in at the kiosk the kiosk said I could pick seats together Then some rude customer svc agent told me i would have to get them assigned at the gate So we get to the gate I talk to another rep at the check in desk she tells me to come back in 15 min I went back 15 min later to be told by the same person oh I'm not working this flight you will have to come back when another person arrives 20 min later another lady came I went back to the desk to be told oh I'm not online yet go have a seat There was no smile no nothing So them the idiot makes an announcement the luggage can be checked at the gate because they might run out of space Then 5 min later she announces my name over the intercom so I go up with a bag I was going to voluntarily check she practically slams our 4 boarding passes on the counter says here's your seats I told her I wanted to check a bag she literally looks at me says go stand back in line there are people ahead of you She is the one that called me to the counter she obviously has my info pulled up so print a check bag ticket I wasn't standing back in that line That's where being nice will get you nowhere with this stupid customer svc rep Jet Blue need to train your customer svc reps on how to have a nicer attitude This whole incident just cost you paying customers", "Boston to Tampa I was told my bag was to big and had to check Fly all the time with this bag and they have never made me check it Cost of 25 Then sitting waiting to board several people with the same bag are waiting to board and the assistant at the Jetblue desk asks if anyone want to check there bag for no fee

arrive at my destination I got on the plane annoyed flight attendants guided and helped people put their luggage in the overhead bins there was free high speed wifi for the duration of the flight lots of leg room a free variety of snacks and drink options tampons and pads in the bathroom Aside from those perks the flight was smooth and they give you a fresh hot towel at the end of the flight I have

pilot announced there was an issue with a valve We ended up deplaning and they said the flight would be 1 2 hours delayed It was a pain but manageable However 3 hours later they announce we'll be delayed another 3 hours It's ridiculous The weather is perfectly fine This is an issue on their end that they should have tested in advance Such an early morning flight If we'd known in good time we would be 6 hours delayed because of an issue on THEIR end we could have at the minimum slept in and had a more relaxing morning to then show up on time for the flight This is an issue that sounds liked it could have been avoided if they were better prepared Highly disappointed", "Newark to Boston I will never use JetBlue again There was no pilot to fly the aircraft Absolutely no respect for the passengers What a horrible and disrespectful airline", "New York JFK to Turks and Caicos While traveling on Jetblue Airways with my wedding gown and grooms attire I was taken back by the lack of support from the flight staff to accommodate our request Not only was the attendant not helpful he did not come up with any alternative options I understand safety is the main priority However our flight was not full and hanging the garments was possible the exception was the unwillingness of the attendant to be solution oriented Instead he crushed my dress over another passengers luggage in an overhead bin Now I have to hold back the tears and pray that the resort can fix our attire for your special day", "Boston to New York It was a very short flight less than 1 hour but the service was great The check in was very easy by the app in the airport a little trouble with the machine and my luggage but it was solved in 5 minutes by the staff The seat is perfect for a short flight and is great they still have inflight service in domestic flights I hope I can fly with this airline in a longer flight", "Make sure you are early for boarding because they close the doors to the gate at JFK before the times posted Also don't bother asking for a manager the employee that closed the flight early refused to show his ID and an NYPD officer had to make him give it to us By the way we later

there was an earlier flight I could be moved to and I explained my travel purposes to her She very kindly made a phone call to get permission to move me to the 7 30 AM flight explaining I'd not seen my son in months She even advocated to waive the fee normally charged for a flight transfer and subsequently was able to do so I was so happy and so grateful I thanked her several times and proceeded to the TSA check in boarded my flight and continued to enjoy my travel experience When I returned to Boston Logan Airport to travel home again I was met with a flight delay which was not the biggest deal to me I made the best of the extra time and opted to go into one of the restaurants and grab a bite to eat I returned to the boarding gate shortly thereafter where I sat waiting to be called for boarding After sitting for approximately ten minutes a JetBlue staff member who said he was in charge came over and began questioning me about how many drinks I'd consumed I told him I had been drinking the Lipton Iced Tea in the bottle I was holding but not been consumed any alcoholic beverages He asked if I'd had anything to eat and I explained I had grabbed a burger at the airport while I was waiting and I gave him the name of the restaurant so he could verify where I'd been and what I consumed but he continued questioning me in front of the other passengers to the point where the conversation turned argumentative After he succeeded in making me feel like a spectacle he proceeded back to the desk by the gate He returned to where I was sitting a couple of minutes later and proceeded to tell me in front of all the other passengers that I was a danger to the flight and it was his job to determine what my level of intoxication might be and he told me he was going to make sure no one on the flight crew served me any alcohol Again despite feeling attached I tried to assure him I had not been drinking I expressed my confusion over where his allegations were coming from and told him about how happy I was with my experience having my flight transferred the day before Eventually after telling me I smelled of alcohol from two seats away he went back to the desk next to the gate When I stood in the line to board the flight he pulled me out of the line and asked me to stand by the desk He called someone he said was his supervisor and turned his back to me and continued to say I was drunk posed a safety hazard After all the other passengers boarded he allowed me to board the flight and made a sarcastic comment about how happy I was with the customer service at JetBlue I did let him know I'd heard everything he said on the phone and my review to the airline would not be 100 positive as I found him to be rude ignorant and unprofessional He stopped me from boarding again and continued with an argumentative tone to tell me he was just doing his job He proceeded to follow me onto the plane where he notified every crew member he felt I was drunk and a danger to the flight", "New York JFK to Burlington Awful disrespectful prejudice and arrogant staff management JetBlue employee was not updating their monitor which I rely on because of my hearing disability and blamed me for not using my other senses to understand that my Group was boarding These disrespectful employees began to blame me for their lack of duty and their lack in communicating to all people of all groups that the plane was boarding", "Boston to Newark The staff and pilots are so nice The flight attendant made sure I got off the plane safely and let me board first One flight I got to go inside the cockpit after we landed and I got to meet a super nice pilot Props to the flight attendant", "Boston to Jacksonville This is my second encounter with JetBlue and I truly fall more in love with the airline each time The flight attendants are so incredibly accommodating and really care about and enforce safety protocol better than any others I've seen You get the whole can of soda if you want you can take three snacks from the basket Legroom is superior to any other short medium haul carrier in the states IFE is not stellar but hell it's there and you get live DirectTV and a decent map feature And free WiFI that was plenty fast enough to be able to watch YouTube I will definitely be going out of my way to fly with JetBlue in the future", "Salt Lake City to Raleigh Durham via New York I flew on standby on my most recent trip with Jetblue I've flown standby many times and I am used to not always getting on the first time I go to the airport but this time was ridiculous I attempted to leave on a Tuesday evening and at the very last second before the flight was closing its doors I was told it was my lucky day and I got one of the last seats on the plane because someone didn't show up I was printed a new ticket with my name and seat assignment checked my carry on since they ran out of overhead bin space found my seat and buckled up I sat there patiently waiting for take off when a stewardess flight attendant came and told me the other person showed up and needed their seat back They escorted me off the plane gave me my bag back and sent me on my way They should not have been able to take me off the plane and give my seat away once they established the previous customer did not get the seat anymore and printed a new ticket with my name and that seat assignment After three days of waiting on standby and being rolled over I finally got a seat on a plane to JFK where I was supposed to connect to RDU and finally get home When I arrived to JFK I found out the attendants that were rolling over my flight the previous days did not roll over my connecting flight each time like they should have or at least they should have notified me I needed to talk to the proper people to get them rolled over so I had to run all over the airport looking for someone who could help me get on the next flight out Every person I dealt with that worked for Jetblue was rude to me cut me off mid sentence thinking they knew what i was asking before I could finish or acted like I was at fault for not doing what I was supposed to even though I was never notified of an issue and if I ever asked questions i was immediately cut off or rushed away so I didn't have to be dealt with Jetblue treats their customers like second class citizens even when they pay the full priced more expensive tickets like I have on previous occasions On top of all this I've also had luggage damaged when flying with them that they refused to take responsibility for They have nice planes but the disappointing customer service and problems they have caused me when trying to travel have definitely turned me off of ever flying with them again", "Santiago de los Caballeros to New York I haven't left the country in 8 years so I was happy that everything has been upgraded Plane was clean Arrived early but alot of my stuff was taken after baggage claim I had a lock on it and it is gone So I will not be riding with this airline again", "Nassau to New York JFK This is by far the worst experience I had with jet blue Also like to fly with them but on the way back to the Bahamas there was engine failure The flight was canceled On top of that they wanted us to fly out the next morning to FL then catch a flight from FL back to JFK I booked a non stop ticket and we wanted to get home So we had to fly to FL and then go back to JFK the same day Did not get in til 12 30 and got home at 2 AM Called them up to see what they can do for us and they ended up giving us 175 per person credit That will expire in 365 days and we have to fly with them again This really did put a bad taste in my mouth after flying with them for so long I don't think I would ever fly with them again They can take the 175 credit and eat it All the hours I spent at the airport and had to do a layover to get home and I get 175 back Total joke I guess JetBlue does not care about customer service I hope my story would help other people out before the book JetBlue", "Tampa to Westchester This was the worst experience I have ever had with an airline First our flight was delayed again and again and again a total of 6 hours until they finally cancelled our flight at midnight For hours they knew that there wasn't going to be a crew to fly us back as the crew timed out do to weather in NY and the jetblue employees chose to lie to everyone for hours pretending like we would be flying out that night When our plane finally arrived at 11pm they told us it would be a quick turnaround and they would get us on board knowing fully well there was no crew Instead of letting everyone know what was going on so that people could make alternate travel plans or even go home to get sleep to get on another flight in the morning they decided to just lie And as the crew was getting off the plane the flight attendant has a smirk on her face and the pilot answers a passenger telling her they knew they had timed out We lost our rental car and non refundable tickets we had to events in NY Fast forward to the next morning with the next flight they put us on after getting 4 hours of sleep we're told our plane has arrived but the captain hasn't given the all clear to board After delaying it 3 times the captain says they hit a bird on the descent into Tampa and need everything inspected We received an email at 6am and 7am saying our flight was delayed So please tell me how at 6 in the morning they knew there would be a delay when the plane that 'hit a bird' just landed at 8 30 and needed to be checked then Long story short we never made our flight and left the airport after waiting a total of 10 hours there and a loss of over 1000 And what do we get from jetblue A 100 voucher hey do not care about their customers at all period Will never fly them again", "Kudos to Jetblue We flew roundtrip Boston to Jacksonville to vacation on the Gulf of Mexico and were there for Hurricane Michael Cat 5 Due to the destruction of the area we decided to pack our bags and return home early so I called Jetblue to reschedule our flight home and talked with a nice staff member Because of the hurricane Jetblue didn't charge change fees or the fare increase they just swapped our tickets to a different day for no charge Wow thank you Jetblue I normally try to fly Jetblue in the US because they have more legroom and otherwise seem better than all the other US carriers Also on the rare occasion that I have to call to change a reservation I haven't waited long and get friendly people to handle it So now I have another reason to like this airline", "Salt Lake City to Boston return First flight got delayed by 4 and a half hours and the flight back got delayed by 3 hours Not because of weather just because it's JetBlue Never using JetBlue again", "Santo Domingo to Fort Lauderdale My last experience with this airline was disastrous I was supposed to fly at 3 45 am and the airline did not stop delaying the flight until it was almost 7 o'clock in the morning when we finally flew not caring about anything at all and without giving a real information of what was happening I personally chose that time to fly because I should be at my job early and end up losing more than half of the day And if that were not enough when we were waiting for flight Nobody was concerned about accommodating their customers in the way that was possible we spent more than 3 hours without eating going cold and unable to sleep But the worst of all is that nobody received an apology for that unforgettable night I am going to make sure that everyone who travels constantly knows about this event so that they do not go through the same thing that I unfortunately had to go through", "Fort Lauderdale to Havana I try to not use this airline when possible due to the rude staff but this flight was the worst I was in the bathroom when the attendants decided to serve drinks and they would not let me pass to my seat I had to stand in the back of the plane the entire time they were serving approx 30 min I will never fly Jetblue again nor will ever recommend them And on top of it the staff were very rude", "Although our flight from Charleston to Boston was delayed this meaning we could potentially miss our connecting flight from BOS to Munich Steven at Charleston airport JetBlue check in desk was extremely helpful and did everything he could for us to make our connection We are very satisfied with his customer service", "Boston to Aruba direct flight The flight both ways was fantastic The cabin staff were amazing understanding friendly and always helpful especially when I requested water The seats were comfy and the plane was new and clean It was a very comfortable flight both ways plenty of room the seats were very comfortable and the seated TVs worked most of the time All in all it was an excellent flight JetBlue never disappoints and I recommend them to everyone", "Boston to Detroit Fast check in at the airport big seats lots of leg room TV screen for each seat free WIFI free snacks and we were encouraged to take more Can't believe they are considered a low cost airline The service is fantastic too", "Me and my family have been flying with Jetblue Airways every year for the past 15 Sometimes situations are beyond their control Late staff weather lack of disclosure due to uncertainty etc Experienced it all However what really bothers me I forgot something on the plane on the flight from San Francisco to Boston realized it as I exited the plane Have told the staff right away made a formal claim at the airport within half hour I haven't retrieved the item yet 3 weeks later You leave anything behind and it's gone no way another passenger would have found it in the deep pocket They couldn't care less Employees go first I guess No work ethic whatsoever Deeply disappointed", "Boston to Ft Lauderdale I can't begin to express my anger and aggravation for JetBlue First the seats on the flight were horrible My lower back was flaring up after the 3 hr flight from BOS to FLL But the worst part of this all they lost my luggage I don't have the normal black or red luggage No this was a bright yellow duffel dry bag One would think that with today's technology of bar code scanning that they would have been able to locate my luggage immediately Not only do they lose it their poor customer service made the process much worse After a week they handed my case to a specialist and he basically did nothing Couldn't even return my voicemails when I asked that he call me back I'm disgusted with this airline", "New York JFK to Portland I am flying with JetBlue for the first time and I didn't have high expectations for a domestic flight I just wanted to give hat's off to JetBlue because it really exceeded my expectations Very comfortable seats Free wifi throughout the flight free snacks and drinks It was a really enjoyable experience", "New York JFK to Boston JetBlue was the worst flying experience We were flying internationally and our return flight to RDU from JFK was cancelled unexpectedly by JetBlue with no notification We rescheduled our flight immediately with Jetblue as we were boarding our international flight and would not have access to phones in order to ensure we were not abandoned at JFK JetBlue then refused to reschedule our flight closer to our original book time We also originally paid for a direct flight and we were placed on a layover flight away from our destination They offered no compensation Worst airline Will never fly again I am strongly encouraging all I know to choose any other airline available Customer service was awful", "On 8 19 18 My husband and I were checking in for our return flight from Las Vegas to Long Beach at the Jet Blue kiosk I am six months pregnant and had a medical emergency which led to me bleeding all over the floor in front of a few staff members The staff at JetBlue immediately took action to help the situation They could tell that we were in shock and embarrassed Not only did they get us a wheelchair and called for an ambulance but also called to have the mess cleaned up right away The staff took our bags stored them and had them delivered to the hospital Also booked us on a flight when I was discharged from the hospital all free of charge Upon our arrival to the gate we were met with flowers a card signed by the staff and a teddy bear for the baby This was so unexpected and we are truly touched by the kindness and generosity of the Jet Blue staff I wish I knew all of their names however we are so full of gratitude for the above and beyond customer service care we were shown", "Newark to Orlando To say that my experience with JetBlue was horrible would be an understatement My flight to Orlando was scheduled to take off at 9 08pm Friday night After sitting in the airport for over and hour with no information we found out our flight would be delayed until 1 15am This is where things went downhill fast After a significant lack of communication from the staff our flight was delayed and pushed back another four times making false promises that the flight was on its way We had asked question after question with little to no response and less than helpful information After waiting for almost 8 hours in the airport seeing plane after plane from other airlines leave the airport we are told that our plane is still in Baltimore completely irreverent to its route and would not be arrriving in Newark due to the pilot being timed out They of course got our hopes up once more by telling us they would be getting a substitute plane and crew to take us to Orlando After waiting ANOTHER hour They cancelled the flight and left the entire waiting area in a panic When searching for an alternate flight not only were they few and far between but JetBlue had serged all their prices for remaining flights and I paid almost 2 500 one way for four tickets with a layover in a Fort Meyers as my only option to get us to our vacation in enough time to actually enjoy it JetBlue should be ashamed of these events and the way they conduct business I will never fly this airline again", "Portland to New York A horrific display of incompetence by one of the ground staff as they backed into the plane breaking their bumper of the towing vehicle and delayed our flight that put it behind a long list of other delayed flights I am typing this having been delayed for several hours as we sit on the tarmac The staff is rude and on edge They don't want to answer any questions by the customers in the plane The staff doesn't seem to know what they are doing and have made a mildly annoying experience into a truly terrible one We will not be flying with Jet Blue ever again", "Fort Lauderdale to Medellin I am disappointed This is the second time I flew with JetBlue in less than a month and both of them I had to change plans due to inconsistency on their times I either missed the next flight connection or departure way too late to ruined plans Jet Blue is economical but it gives me a sense that they overbook more than other airlines creating more stress on their passengers due to the lack availability", "New York to Jacksonville First and last experience with this airline Thinking back I should have clued in to what might lay ahead with this airline since we departed JAX for JFK on another airline and I had noticed then that several of the JetBlue flights had been canceled that were leaving around the same time as ours and our Delta flight departed as scheduled We had booked JetBlue for our return flight and had arrived on an international flight so had 7 hr layover Another clue that I should have picked up on the enormous customer service line located at the JetBlue gate area and the number of people that were crying After waiting 5 hrs for our scheduled flight we were advised 2 hrs prior to departure that our flight was canceled Waited in line 1 5 hrs for the agent to tell us they had no available flights for our family of 5 to to get out of New York until 3 days later no compensation for accommodations there were cots in baggage claim to sleep on and in addition this airline does not work with other airlines to look for other travel availability only what is available in the JetBlue system We are a family that travels frequently and realize there can always be issues with travel due to weather and other related issues however this airline has no alternative options to get you where you need to go in a reasonable timeframe other than what is in their airline inventory We had an extra day to allow for issues which would normally be sufficient for any of the other airlines we have flown We ended up Ubering to Philadelphia to rent a car and make a 17 hr drive to our destination all on our dime which cost about 300 more than the airline tickets for all 5 of us Oh but they did offer us a refund how generous No we will not ever book with JetBlue again if the choice is ours and I will tell everyone I know about our experience to warn them about this airline Bottom line if it's important for you to actually get to your destination as you booked it and you don't have some major flexibility with your plans this is not a bargain in the least", "Cancun to New York I am beyond disgusted with my experience with Jet Blue Our flight on the way to Cancun was delayed due to a flight attendant not making it on time and our flight going back to JFK is delayed every 30 mins to another hour later Our originally scheduled flight that was leaving at 12 30 became 1 30 then 2 10 then 3 10 then 3 44 and so on and so forth until we arrived at the 6 30 pm time Instead of being honest about the delay from the very beginning jetblue continued to send those emails leaving me at the airport for over 7 8 hours and my puppy at home alone without any secondary options When I called for Help it was not the service level you could've expected I hung up the phone unsatisfied and even more disappointed than before With every employee giving me a different answer such as JFK has shut down all incoming and outgoing flights not true as there was another Jetblue flight that came in to the flight is in the air and will arrive soon also not true as the flight hasn't even left off yet We have waited 8 hours so far and are expected to wait another 6 7 hours Jetblue just continuously lie and lie and lie JThey care about money more than service that shows you the level of commitment that Jetblue has", "Ft Lauderdale to Albany Worst airline I have ever flown They lied to us for hours as we sat on the plane and then the terminal The aircraft was old stewardess were rude and misleading I could not more displeased with an airline", "Orlando to New York I will never fly JetBlue again After canceling our first direct flight and changing it to a flight the next day with a layover with my two little ones to a return flight that was delayed 6 hours for maintenance issues the man at the counter said he recommend trying to change our flight because something is very very wrong with the plane They put us on a new flight where they tried to seat my three year old by herself and said we could only sit together if we paid an upgrade charge of 40 per ticket Only after speaking with a supervisor did they refund that money After all of this they lost one of our bags and left the rest of our bags in a rainstorm Everything is soaking wet and anything electronic ruined Last night they told us they had our missing bag but now they say they haven't found it at all and can't do anything to compensate for what's inside owlette monitor summer baby monitor etc I find the customer service unacceptable and do not recommend flying with them especially if you have young children and value your things you entrust to them", "Nashville to Boston I would recommend staying away from Jetblue I really don't think they know what they are doing I flew with them in January 2018 for the first time as Travelocity gave me this airline option I was stuck at the FLL airport for an over 6 hour delay The staff kept giving different reasons as to why the plane was late they offered junk food as a consolation and ultimately it was chaos and very anxiety provoking Now I know they travel a lot to the east coast and it was January which would likely cause some flight delays So I figured I could be fair and give them another try later on as they did give me a 100 flight credit per their bill of rights I was very anxious about it so for about a month before my flight I checked my flight every single night that I'd be flying on to see if there were major delays again I needed to be mentally prepared and if it looked rough I was just going to pay for something else Well other than most Saturdays and one Friday the flight from Nashville to Boston 7 37 PM departure time was delayed However it was at most about a three hour delay at best 30 minutes I was mentally prepared though and ready for my likely at worst 3 hour delay I mean I live in Nashville so no biggied if I am delayed out of my own city but what a surprise when I get a text that my 7 37 PM flight was delayed until 12 54 AM We didn't leave Nashville until 2 19 AM I got into Boston at 6 30 AM and I should have been there at 11 00 PM the night prior So my Saturday was very rough considering I only had 2 hours of airplane sleep When I had talked with customer service during the delay fiasco they were of no help One rep literally told me good luck and hung up Also I am glad I didn't try to get on the flight that next morning from Nashville to Boston because it was cancelled I felt so lucky that I didn't trust Jetblue enough to book them for my flight home I flew Southwest home and of course no problems per usual So I'd stay away from Jetblue I gave them a second chance and it was basically the same situation as the first time I flew with them I learned my lesson I will pay more for dependability no doubt about that", "New York to Phoenix Coming and going there was delays Seats are broken down and won't lean back on either trip Cabin pressure is horrible so be ready to be tortured as you descend Crew doesn't understand customer service and seems to hate their job No first class seating just their extended seat but what's the point when it's all old nasty seats Never will fly again best to just fly on a larger airline name", "Philadelphia to Boston Please do not waste your time or money flying with this service JetBlue is the worst Pay the extra money and fly with a reliable air service Booked a flight Aug 3rd 2018 from Philadelphia to San Juan PR with 1 stop in Boston 2 hrs prior to boarding received a text message flight was delayed every few minutes there after kept getting delayed messages until finally they cancelled the flight minutes before we were supposed to board No explanation only compensation was rebooking for the 5th which made no sense since I was due to return on the 7th Terrible customer service too Employees at stand laughing and clowning around I requested a full refund and instead the employee rebooked me without my consent spent 30 more mins on the phone to get refund My entire trip ruined Do not waste your time This is a common trend for JetBlue to cancel flights Terrible service Pay a little more to fly with reliable air service Don't take the chance I lost my chance to surprise my kids who are in PR on vacation Very sad was devastated", "Newark to Fort Lauderdale On August 2nd 2018 we had the worse experience with Jetblue Sitting in the airport we got an email not even a phone call that flight was cancelled The Jetblue staff couldn't get the computer to over ride the new reservations they were trying to make Finally got re booked through Tampa and then Silver Air to Fort Lauderdale As I was boarding I was told I had a seat change due to a child flying by themselves No prior warning at all by the Jetblue crew I was separated from my party The Silver Air flight was also delayed and a propeller plane that seats 36 people Not what we paid for Jetblue response was a 25 goodwill credit That is more of an insult to me There are way better choices then this airline They used to be great Also stay away from Newark Airport constant delays", "Washington to Charleston The flight to Charleston was delayed 3 hours with no explanation given and the return flight to DCA was delayed 5 hours due do mechanical issue No travel voucher or compensation of any kind was offered We were told that there may have been pizza ordered for the flight Once you account for the additional hours waiting for the flight the flight wasn't worth the fare at all", "Charlotte to Portland via New York Did not give accommodation when flight was delayed despite two different employees telling me I would recieve accommodation because the delay was not weather related When I landed at my layover and asked for accommodation they refused and claimed the delay actually was weather related", "Nassau to Fort Lauderdale Worst airline I've ever used They canceled the flight while we were waiting at the gate and basically told everyone good luck There were no other flights for 4 days so my kids first vacation in 3 years was canceled Then I had to wait hours to get my bags back so I could leave The staff were apologetic and it seemed like they were used to taking abuse for canceled flights but there wasn't anything they could do to help anyone I've flown other airlines that have had to cancel flights but they all either sent another plane or send larger planes for the next flight to get the people where they needed to be JetBlue didn't try to do anything to get anyone anywhere I will never use them again I'd rather not travel if they are my only option If they are the only option you won't be traveling anyway", "Orlando to Newark Never will fly again was supposed to land in Newark plane magically gets cancelled due to weather that is a complete lie there was no weather issue Found out from a JetBlue employee that it was mechanical issues they put us on another flight going to JFK 50 miles out of the way to get delayed another 4 hours due to weather issues that didn't exist JetBlue sucks don't use them they always have weather issues when everything is perfectly fine they are the only airline with weather issues", "Santo Domingo to San Juan Worst airline I have ever flown on My husband and I were on our honeymoon in DR when it came time to fly home our shuttle at the resort was late and we got to the airport an hour before our departure time We got to the check in line staff were so rude I was disgusted by it The staff treated us like dirt and on top of that they closed the gate on us and didn't let us get our flight We had to wait 8 hours for the next flight Horrible way to end our honeymoon My husband and I will never fly with JetBlue Airways ever again", "New York to Sarasota After travelling 30 hours from Nepal on Qatar Airways with my two kids I had a connecting flight on Jetblue to Tampa What should have been a 3 hrs fight turned into a 5 days ordeal We were on the Initial flight on the 22nd of July which left the gate and then after being in the tarmac for 3 hrs they returned us back to the terminal because the delay caused one of the crew to be above legal flying time allowed Our initial flight was eventually cancelled at around 2 00 AM the next day and they gave no compensation citing the cancellation was because of weather I had to be in the line for more than an hour to book our flights for the next day I was told we were booked for the next day flight but when we reached the gate the next day they told us we didn't have any confirmed seats in any of the JetBlue flights Same thing happened for a couple of days Finally after 4 days they gave me an option to fly out to Sarasota In between they told me they had misplaced my luggage and was asked for me to find out where my luggage was So after 5 days without any luggage they put me in a flight to a different destination and to top it off they put us in completely different areas of the aircraft and while I was trying to console my 7 year old to go sit with a stranger the flight attendant asks us to take our seat promptly Please do not fly JetBlue because they have zero passenger concern they seriously need to fire the guy who manages the flights and reorganize They were completely disorganized desk and the person on the phone telling me I had confirmed flights while the gate told me I didn't have any Baggage getting lost and they had no clue where it was last scanned rude desk people Complete chaos", "This is the third time this month my flight has been cancelled I have lost days of vacation lots of money and my time The last reason that my connecting flight was canceled is because of maintenance issues I have purchased around 10 tickets this month July 2018 for my father and I combined and the only compensation Jetblue Airways gives you is a one time 100 credit you can only use towards another same airline purchase It's unbelievable Never had such a horrible experience", "Flight got canceled last minute due to weather even though it was clear skies in New York and Jacksonville Was told I would have to wait two days for another flight and when I complained got a flight out the next day with a four hour layover in Boston only to find out that the first plane has been delayed indefinitely Customer service is nonexistent and they have no desire to get anyone out of the airport anytime soon The car rental hey K budget has raised rates on their rental cars the hotels have raise their rates both because they know flights have been canceled and there's nothing that the customer can do about it", "We got an email that our flight from Houston to Boston on 7 17 18 was cancelled just 10hr before our departure I have an interview next day in Boston and it was too late to change or cancel accommodations and car rental I was told by JetBlue representative that my only options were to wait until the next flight which was 2 days away or just get a refund of the cost of my flight She refused to help me find another flight on another carrier To keep my interview I have to book our new flight from different airline which can take me to Boston next day and it cost us extra 253 each ticket more It was horrible and made us crazy to find a last minute flight that didn't cost 2000 We arrive in Boston at 3pm early morning and JetBlue refuse to refund us extra cost for our new flight It was so disappointed We took JetBlue back home on 7 20 18 Got 3 times email delay notification This was our first time with JetBlue our overall experience was a nightmare We will never take JetBlue in the future again", "Punta Cana to Boston The best experience ever traveling the first time with my son For some reasons our seats were not all in one row with my husband my son and I My son was very upset that they separate us and the

them enough Thank you for the best experience ever and for made us as a family feel valuable Thank you for accommodating us", "Atlanta to Boston By far worst airline I have ever flown with Most unhelpful staff you could imagine they could not care less about what your flight plans are and how they can help you My flight was originally at 5AM to Boston then I had a connecting flight to Bar Harbor Maine at 11 My flight to Boston was delayed 5 times and then we had to move to a whole different gate with no explanation After being delayed so many times I missed my connecting flight not one employee tried or acted like they wanted to help me find a new flight After I found a flight every attendant refused to print out a boarding pass for me even though they could I would never take this airline again Awful costumer service and miserable traveling experience", "Atlanta to Boston Great on phone customer service but horrible in person service members JetBlue cancelled a flight I had booked and placed me on a red eye the next morning only for the flight to be delayed by 3 hours When I complained to a customer service representative she cancelled my flight for that day and again I missed my flight and had to re book a flight for a later time in the day They offered me no vouchers and showed no empathy Worst customer service Very unprofessional Will never fly JetBlue again", "Booked a one way flight from Richmond to Tampa The first flight was delayed for 2hrs the second flight had already taken off by the time I arrived to the next airport So I had to book another flight for Tampa which caused me to wait at the airport another 12hrs As I was getting ready to board the second flight I found out it was cancelled so I had to book another flight for Orlando instead of Tampa which caused me to wait another 5 hrs because there was nothing available All off these cancellations and delays caused me to miss out on my daughters birthday which is very unacceptable This my first time flying with JetBlue and has been the worst experience ever", "I am reviewing two flights the first from LAX to JFK I really like that the airline treats adults as adults and not like children they have a more hands off attitude non hovering The system is quite efficient and flows well There don't appear to be any meals on board which became a problem on our return from JFK to LAX The plane was boarded 3 hours late each update was another 15 minute delay making it impossible to get some food before boarding We ate a small breakfast thinking we could easily get to our destination as scheduled and eat an early dinner once in LA The delay made the on flight snacks barely adequate and we were starving once we arrived There are no healthy snacks the only offerings are potato chip type bags with carbohydrate and fat loaded ingredients I guess that's ok if your 20 years old but for many it is undesirable unhealthy and inadequate When my wifes Southwest flight was delayed two hours she received a 100 voucher so far we have seen nothing from Jet Blue and that's okay we understand delays occur but they need to have contingency preparations in place There are many things to like about Jet Blue the seats are very comfortable the legroom is good the entertainment screens are excellent This is an airline that wants to excel and I think it does perhaps the decision makers need to take a flight and experience what the traveler experiences and they would understand any deficiencies better One last thing the cabin temperature was very cold I am 63 and needed a jacket often times I think my age makes me less tolerant of cold but the 30 year old lady sitting next to me had the blanket on and couldn't cover up enough she was also quite uncomfortable", "This will be my first JetBlue experience and it will be my last My flight was supposed to leave at 10am this morning it's after midnight and I'm still at the airport After a twice delayed flight that eventually was canceled I was booked on a flight scheduled to leave at 7 48pm About an hour before the flight it was delayed for 2 hours Once we received that delay there have been 5 more now we're supposed to leave at 2am The crew here can't give us clear answers one minute it's going to be earlier than they think the next we get another alert of a delay Multiple other airlines have taken off from CLT to JFK I've even seen a plane return from JFK that took off from CLT while I've been waiting Ultimately I'd like clear honest answers rather than deliveries of false hope Also some kind of compensation for the extreme inconvenience would be nice but so far it's just been a bottle of water disappointed to say the least", "Fort Lauderdale to Los Angeles Gate agents in LAX are extremely rude JetBlue must have many complaints because they refuse to let customers speak with a supervisor All communication is done through the dearjetblue site It's a useless back and forth where nothing gets accomplished Furthermore their small credit vouchers are for future use on the airline Once again useless for customers who no longer wish to fly JetBlue There are other options for paying customers Next time I'll take my business to another airline especially one that has more destinations and more tactful employees", "JetBlue has become a horrible airline to fly with On this four and a half flight there were several issues I upgraded to more space seats for 170 because the airline strategically blocks off many of the seats so that you cannot sit with your spouse There was no entertainment on this flight The wifi did not work either Apparently their entire systems were down according to the announcement They would give you a 15 voucher IF you booked through them but would have to jump through hoops because the booking was done through Expedia As soon as we took off the staff made an announcement that there were no sandwiches or salads available on this flight for sale Thanks for letting us know after boarding The plane itself was old and dirty The seat was hard as a wood plank due to the foam material degrading Also the cabin was freezing cold and had to spend 5 per blanket to keep warm because they would not increase cabin temperature Worse flight I've taken in a while and that's saying something since I rarely complain", "Jetblue cancel our flight today from Orlando to San Juan July 9 2018 party of 6 with a Minor They book another flight from Orlando to Ponce which is an hour and half drive they told us when we arrived to go to baggage claim in Ponce and they will give us transportation to San Juan for free Once we arrived to Ponce at 12 30am Jetblue says that they didnt received no emails from Orlando and it was our problem we also waited 9 hours for our flight in Orlando The supervisor in Jetblue Ponce was very rude She didn't wanted to help us knowing that we were with a minor I have been a regular traveler with Jetblue for years I will never again use that airline", "While my trip was for the most part satisfactory the return trip from Tampa to Westchester was problematic to say the least I dealt with not only an extremely rude flight crew but the crew onboard the aircraft did little to keep the passengers updated with the status of our delay Due to a cracked taxi light the flight was delayed and the flight crew notified us twice the first notification came when we were initially told about the need for repairs and a tape up and the second came over an hour later when we were told that we would be getting on our way shortly The trip down to Tampa from New York was more than satisfactory but that return trip was problematic from the very start I shared the sentiment of a frequent flyer one row behind me who was very vocal about her disappointment with the airline and their handling of the delay Despite these things there was a very nice selection for entertainment which included free in flight TV service and WiFi which came as a shock to me Overall it was not an amazing experience and I would recommend this airline but it would be a matter of comparison If I had to recommend an airline to someone where JetBlue was one of many options I would opt for the other options", "At first I read several reviews about JetBlue not being so good But after my flight from Denver to Boston and back found staff and flight attendants very attentive to my family's needs can get all the snacks we needed for the flight very friendly very helpful Roomy seats and another bonus is that every seat had a TV Our flights were delayed a little bit but not due to anything with JetBlue it was with weather incoming in both cities I would recommend JetBlue to anybody hope this helps you out", "Boston to West Palm Beach Got to the airport and had the best experience I've ever had flying We asked to change our seats at the front desk area and staff were extremely helpful and made sure that our experience was nothing short of exceptional The team out of Boston Logan airport are very professional and 100 put the customers first 10 out of 10 from us", "New York to Barbados I have been using Jetblue for years and I have no complaints Great service great staff skilled pilots and last but not least friendly and kind flight attendants", "Never Again I travel from NJ to Boston several times a year to visit family Since I have 2 small children ages 4 and 7 sometimes I fly because it is generally quick and easy The Newark to Boston flight was slightly delayed and my tv did not work but was otherwise uneventful The trip home from Boston to Newark was a nightmare My family lives over an hour from the airport and on the drive I got a text from the airline stating the flight will be delayed an hour We were having some bad weather so that was understandable I just had to try to entertain my kids for a bit longer in the airport We boarded the flight at the delayed time and sat on the aircraft for over half an hour just to be told by the pilot they did not get clearance from Newark and it may be another hour for take off They let us deplane After dragging my kids further around he airport to get snacks and games I noticed that every single JetBlue flight in the terminal was extremely delayed We returned to the gate to see a big cancelled on the flight board No announcement made We were then told to go to customer service to see about getting another flight After sitting in an airport for hours I now had to drag my kids to another spot to wait in a very long line At the desk the rep told me the flight was canceled because the delays caused the crew to time out Basically they up and left stranding a whole plane of people with nowhere to go The rep offered me options on another flight which would land at a NY airport over 2 hours from my home or an 8 pm flight that she told me would most likely be delayed Neither were reasonable options for my situation I chose to take a flight at noon the next day since my kids were at their limits of patience I asked for compensation since I would have to get a hotel for the night and was told no it was not their fault since they canceled for weather Seems to me like the crew abandoning ship was why they canceled Meanwhile other airlines were flying no problem Now I had to drag my 2 exhausted kids through the airport to reclaim my bags and hope to secure accommodation for the night I was told that most of the hotels at the airport were booked but the reservation agent at Logan found me a hotel 10 miles outside of the city We had to wait for a shuttle during rush hour in the rain A 15 minute ride turned into 40 minutes What should have been a quick easy 45 minute flight turned into a 24 hour nightmare It was needlessly stressful and exhausting I felt like I was left stranded with 2 small kids It had been a couple of years since I flew JetBlue and I used to love them Not anymore From the other reviews I read it seems like my experience is not uncommon I will pay extra to use United next time or Amtrak I will not be using JetBlue anymore This airline is really declining", "New York to West Palm Beach Getting there was ok although I didn't get the chance to pick my seats so we had to ask people to move since we traveled with children They cancelled my flight home which was totally inconvenient We were then booked for the next day and couldn't stay an extra day so they rebooked us but to fly out of another airport and had less than 3 hours to get ready to go since the time also changes So we raced to pack say goodbye and leave We didn't have any time to put gas in our rental car and had to just drop it off and pay the outrageous fee for gas Finally got to the new airport and again had to ask people to move so we could sit with our children Was very stressful", "Newark to Orlando The experience is horrible At the check in they had no vacant seats together so they didn't assign me a seat saying they will do that at the gate At the gate they gave us seats 7B 19D and 24D That meant My 5 years old child was seating alone 5 rows behind me The Jet Blue personnel is absolutely unprofessional they didn't even apologize and just blamed us by saying that we supposed to come earlier The whole situation is ridiculous Jet Blue's decision was to put us on another flight or fly as it is We asked a few people to change their seats but they refused the suggestion When I buckled up My child he couldn't understand what is going on and of course started to cry He didn't want to be separated or to sit with someone he didn't know even though the couple next to him was very sweet I was too stressed to deal with this and tried to talk to him about it One of the passengers started to go around and ask people and finally she managed to put us together I am so thankful to that woman She said I am a mother of five and we'll make everything it takes for this guy to be with his mom' The worst airlines ruined my day but a lovely people pulled it all together", "Boston to Atlanta Poor departure gate service Disrespectful gate agents with a nasty and condescending attitude Did not permit elderly sufficient time to board Seats changed to the back of the plane", "Extremely disappointed I've actually been recommending Jetblue Airways even though it has the lowest rating We had a weather delay which is understandable We deplaned at the 3 hour mark We sat at the gate an additional hour and half waiting for further instruction when we were told the flight was cancelled to get our bags and call the 1 800 number for further assistance The crew walked off saying they were off duty The 800 number representatives refer you back to the airport staff which now we can't speak with as we were no longer in the security area The retrieving of bags was a total mess it took at least 2 hours for our bags to get pulled off due to so many cancellations Now I have to wait 2 days to get a flight out not even comparable to the original booking Isn't a whole plane full of cancelled people enough to add the additional flight that's already been paid for The worst thing is Delta flew in the same weather they never deplaned and actually got off the ground and to their destination I was also told the system world automatically rebook my flight When I enquired about this process there was no clear understanding by the representative as to how this even happens At this point", "We were done in Boston and went to the airport We had boarding passes for 10 pm flight Most airlines let you fly standby same day as it gives them more opportunities to sell higher tickets later Checkin manager could not care less 150 to fly earlier We went to the gate and none of their employees would help 4 planes left with empty seats Is that good customer service Why advertise and send us specials every Tuesday if that is how you treat good customers We can talk about the nonworking direct tv or joke website which does not save info kicks you off and has not improved in 15 years with the internet or flight delays when it is convenient for you but you rudely treat good customers and train employees not to use common sense Just booked our Sept flight to Boston on Delta", "Portland to New York JFK Pros Lots of free snacks such as pop chips sweet potato chips cheeze its and choc chip cookies In flight wifi that includes free messaging In flight TV channels Cons Very limited number of airports they fly in and out of within the US Their planes have an outdated interior like really outdated TV screens on the back of seats that are super pixelated and are no bigger than 5'x5' squares This is your only means of watching the inflight TV channels and movies The movies have to be started at the beginning of your flight they start on their own channel and can't be paused They charge 80 for the exit row I personally had a not great experience on my flight home when our six hour flight was delayed due to catering only to then be told that catering couldn't make it to our plane so they just left without the food for the flight I also ended up in a seat with a broken headphone jack that only emitted a high pitched squeal so I couldn't watch the tv The TV tray at my seat was also broken causing anything on it to slide into the aisle I reported all these things to JetBlue only to be told that my trouble was worth a 15 refund I paid 650 roundtrip", "Excellent flight with jetblue Mint business class Our bags were taken to get checked in by a lovely jetblue mint team member We got expedited security clearance too We boarded on time and got seated Our flight attendants came round and introduced themselves and asked if this was our first time flying mint Our amenity kits and a little note were left on the seat They came round with noise cancelling headphones for everyone They asked if we would like a drink and myself and my husband chose the refresh mint cocktail They came round and cleared cups before we took off Bottles of water provided at every seat in advance Seat was super comfortable I loved the fact the offer directTV entertainment this was great The inflight wifi worked perfect and I could stream facebook live The food again was lovely we ordered the plane eats menu and everything was tasty The only slight gripe was that the croutons on the salad were soggy But that's all I could say Excellent selection of alcoholic drinks Ice cream for pudding and I chose a lovely freshly brewed coffee A decent choice of wines with our meal I settled down as we flew at night and got around 3 hours sleep It was lovely The duvet pillow and seat were all comfortable Cabin and toilets all clean They left us a milkbar cookie to take home I would definitely fly jetblue mint again", "Me and my wife had a bad experience with Jetblue's staff on a flight to Cancun from Ft Lauderdale Our 21 month old toddler was crying a lot with no clear reasons why My wife and I were trying our best to calm her down The air hostess comes over and says that we need to calm her down because we were disturbing other passengers Of course we don't want our baby to be crying and do NOT want her to be distressed We were trying our best to soothe her down but nothing was helping This was totally unexpected When the airline was contacted they did apologize but at the same time they reiterated that the air hostess did not do anything wrong So basically Jetblue is a non infant toddler friendly airline for sure And they support their staff when they do anything wrong", "I was flying yerstaday on Jet blue from Fort Lauderdale to Newark It was 2 hours delayed due to a weather On the plane I was dehydrated and taking medication I ask the staff 2 times to buy a food box for 8 He never came back I went over to ask where it was and he said he forgot Since I travel a lot on Jetblue the service went down and the staff are not accommodating to customers Very unhappy", "Always delayed Today we suffered more than 2 hours delayed This is the second time this month JetBlue doesn't care about customer time I will no use this airline anymore WiFi doesn't work Airplanes looks old and no maintenance maybe that is because they have so menu problems and delays", "Washington DC to Jacksonville Flight was delayed with no explanation took a full hour to get our luggage back because the ramp was closed because of lightning even though all the other airlines where getting bags in", "Minneapolis to Boston Horrible 6 00 am flight was initially delayed 2 hours just minutes after boarding Then it was delayed a half hour at a time all day long Sitting at the airport now 7 hour delay and still counting No answers They gave us snack bags of chips and pretzels at the 5 hour mark for the inconvenience What a joke", "Atlanta to Boston Worst customer service experience of my life Even changed my flight booking against my wishes No one cared to help when their plane was delayed 2 hours and I missed my international connection leaving me stranded in the Boston airport for 22 hours Never again", "Nashville to Fort Lauderdale I got an email that my flight was cancelled 6 hours before takeoff for 'maintenance issues' As we were going on vacation it was too late to change or cancel accommodations and car rental I was told by two supervisors that my only options were to wait until the next flight which was 2 days away make a 4 5 hr drive to Atlanta for a flight tomorrow or just get a refund of the cost of my flight They refused to help me find another flight on another carrier As we already had several thousand dollars invested in this vacation I had no choice but to do all the legwork and somehow manage to find a last minute flight that didn't cost 2 000 I did get one thank goodness that had multiple stops was 3 hours longer and didn't get in until after midnight I called Jetblue back to have them refund my flight and see if they could refund me the extra 269 00 it cost for my new flight They refused and said they would only refund the cost of the flight and give a 100 flight voucher for my 'inconvenience' Beware of Jetblue when there are problems if you've read anything on this page you should see that they are ill prepared for issues or to compensate customers for what could be severe financial burdens I felt like neither supervisor I spoke with was willing to go even a little above and beyond to help me out I declined the vouchers and told them I would never fly JetBlue again it's not worth the stress and the risk", "Chicago to New York I had a multi country international trip booked which started with Jetblue flight in Chicago When I arrived to the airport flight was cancelled and no help was offered whatsoever I had to book my own flight running around airport like crazy to make it to JFK for my international flight When I called Jetblue representative refused to issue me a refund Never again jetblue Choose a responsible airlines", "Washington to Fort Lauderdale Horrible experience M my flight was scheduled for 4pm and the flight kept getting delayed over and over We took off at 2am It was a real nightmare Worst airline ever", "Orlando to Washington Our first flight to our destination was fine Standard reclining seat drinks and snacks offered Felt disappointed that our seats on the way back from our trip didn't recline When we asked if we could move into the empty seats behind us after take off we were told that it would be an upgrade charge Mind you the plane was a tiny two seater and it was not an upgrade in class or even leg room we just asked for seats that reclined They also set the AC to super low and purposely sold blankets We paid over 300 00 for each of our seats since when is it an upcharge to recline your chair and be frozen The flight attendant wasn't much help either and was dry with his responses", "Boston to San Diego Absolutely horrible experience My family was placed on a Mint flight in economy class without our knowledge The flight was delayed upwards of 3 hours because a catering truck for first class passengers had not yet arrived There was absolutely no reason for the delay other than their shortage of catering for first class passengers It wasn't unfair to every other customer on the flight and it is appalling to me that this seems to be happening all over the country with JetBlue flights I will not be flying JetBlue again and I certainly hope to be compensated for this outrageous inconvenience", "Washington to Boston The flight itself was late both for departure and landing We were late more than 10 minutes for departure and landing but some of this was due to low visibility conditions Additionally the employees at the kiosk were very unaware of when the aircraft would be getting in They also failed to change the flight monitor at the gate to the delayed time Despite these inconveniences we did depart and land safely with very little turbulence The seating was pretty comfortable and the in flight WiFi actually worked to my surprise The overall flight was not bad and I wouldn't mind flying with jetBlue again", "Fort Lauderdale to Salt Lake City My wife has a severe peanut allergy I always double check to make sure it's in the system Our return flight did not have the peanut allergy on my wife's profile from the first flight I had them add it and once we went to our gate the person in charge checked the ticket because we board early to wipe the seats and he said it wasn't in their system life and death allergies are no joke", "Aruba to Detroit via Ft Lauderdale This was my first time traveling JetBlue and it was the worst experience Firstly the app would not allow me to check in the terminal kiosk would not allow me to check it Therefore I was forced to stand in line to check in with an agent Next my flight was delayed due to maintenance I had an extremely close connection at the Ft Lauderdale airport The most stressful day of travel Upon my return flight again the app and check in kiosk were not available to me My second flight was delayed three hours again due to maintenance I met a couple on my trip who also flew Jetblue to our destination and they missed their connecting flight and was forced to spend the night in Ft Lauderdale due to plane maintenance With all this maintenance that you're performing you would think the planes would be impeccable I will spend the extra 200 in the future and fly Delta I have nothing positive to say about my experience and I will not give them a second chance", "Long Beach to Las Vegas We purchased our tickets to make a concert at 8pm in Las Vegas Our flight time was supposed to be leaving at 4 56pm Our flight has been delayed 3 times Now until 8 pm Now we our out the 500 for our tickets and jetblue could care less I will never use this airline again", "Ft Lauderdale to Quito I was really disappointed in the interior of the plane on my recent flight Before flying my impression of JetBlue was that the airline had high quality entertainment and interiors The plane flying to Quito was really worn out Whole rows of screens were not working and flickering quickly My row fortunately worked at first but then failed about 2 hours into the flight The attendants seemed to have trouble speaking clearly over the intercom The plane was also uncomfortably hot I was impressed by the in flight service but the low quality of the plane was deeply disappointing The JetBlue gate area in FLL is also very overcrowded and low on services This makes me really weary of taking JetBlue to South America or the Caribbean again", "My flight was from Port of Spain to New York on 5 4 18 One member of cabin staff was very lazy not helpful at all extremely rude towards crew members and passengers I asked for tea or coffee and he said there was no more with an attitude meanwhile the other flight attendant got me the coffee with any hesitation and was extremely polite snd helpful I'm very disappointed with this situation seeing that I've always had good experiences with Jetblue Several passengers dealt with the same issue and were all complaining during the flight It was very unfortunate that the other crew members had to deal with this attitude as well", "Denver to Boston Jetblue made my expensive trip to Boston miserable They don't care to indicate online as to which seats do not tilt back so I picked the wrong seat Had 1 hour of sleep on the plane and was absolutely spent the next day during classes I complained to a stewardess and she didn't care less No place else to complain to with jetblue I hate these people", "Houston to New York JFK I have not flown jetBlue in a while and just wanted to say that the crew of B6 282 on 3rd May are doing a phenomenal job Very rarely have I seen such a hospitable and nice crew I hope the crew gets at least some recognition for their efforts as it is too often I encounter very unfriendly and unpleasant flight staff I will be looking to fly jetBlue from now on", "On Sat April 28 I was flying on flight 959 from Bradley international to Fort Lauderdale at what was suppose to be 7 45am According to the JetBlue staff the first delay was due to chipped paint at the nose of the aircraft that needed to be fixed Then an entire hour later they ran into an over fueling issue that set us back The JetBlue staff stated that specific plane was ready for take off to San Juan PR and was not prepared to travel to Fort Lauderdale with that much fuel and had to wait for the fuel service to come and fix the problem My sister and I had our children with us and had to board the carnival cruise by 3 30pm at the Miami port which is at least 45mins away from Fort Lauderdale with traffic We did not leave Bradley until about 10 10am So as you figured we did not make it in time to board our cruise for my sons 8th birthday We did not receive a dime back and had to return flight back home the next morning Seeing we are in spring and it was an early enough flight we did not think insurance was necessary I'm so disappointed in Jetblue and will never pick this airline as first choice", "On the way from Ft Lauderdale to Punta Cana our flight was delayed an hour and then we sat on the plane for two hours waiting for fuel while Spirit planes came and went the whole time On the way home we were delayed an hour on the flight from Punta Cana to FL and then our flight from FL to Charleston delayed an hour and a half no explanation why Every single flight was delayed Not like a ten minute delay but an hour or more Incredibly frustrating And only one flight attendant we encountered was actually friendly Will fly any other airline if at all possible If you have somewhere to be don't fly JetBlue", "San Francisco to Jacksonville via New York JFK They put us at the very back of the plane on the way to JFK on our outbound plane The seats did not recline and they were next to the bathroom For our return flight we had to change the day and when we did that the airline associate we spoke to said they would not put us in the back on our return flight Oddly enough when we arrived in JFK for our return flight we were told we had the seats in the back of the plane again The associate at the gate was extremely rude when we said that we were told that we would not get those seats Bottom line is this airline has no integrity We're very disappointed I will from here on out be very opposed to flying this airline", "Detroit to Fort Lauderdale This was without a doubt the worst traveling experience I've ever encountered We sat on the terminal for over two hours waiting to 'de ice ' Mind you I counted over 10 planes come in and take off while we continued to sit there With the whole flight crew knowing that they had over 85 of the flight needing to be on time with their connecting flights We were assured that the crew did not know any information and they could do nothing to help us Once we landed the captain casually said that we were over two hours late He never apologized for the horrible landing or terrible timing that had occurred Then we were advised to go the help desk and we would be assisted there They had one staff member helping our whole flight We weren't booked to fly out until the next day in which we had to fight to get a hotel to stay in for over night Jet Blue did not care about anyone's time management or money Every single flight that we had or saw was delayed It is the worst airline I've ever flown on and will never recommend it to anyone", "Ft Lauderdale to Richmond Flight leaving Fort Lauderdale was delayed several times without any explanation Staff was rude and very unfriendly The supervisor was the rudest of all I told her she was deflecting she replied I'm offended by your language First and last time utilizing this airline", "New York JFK to Antigua Long delays without notification nor explanation Told to arrive 3 hours before departure then delayed over 2 hours Flight attendants seemed very unhappy to be on board After such inconvenience it would have been nice to receive a complimentary drink or at least a smile from their employees Not a Happy airline", "New York JFK to Orlando Very impressed The seats had so much legroom and were very well padded The flight attendants did a great job serving everybody drinks and snacks Although on their A320s the IFE is not that good They have direct TV but you had to order the movies or something and headphones were 5 but only with credit debit", "Detroit to Fort Lauderdale I am very disappointed in my recent flying experience with Jet Blue My boyfriend and I were traveling to Cancun for a getaway on the way there we had a connecting flight to Fort Lauderdale with a layover time of 43 minutes We were delayed as the plane needed to be deiced prior to takeoff which set us back 25 minutes Our flight was a smooth flight landing in fort Lauderdale 22 minutes prior to us needing to get on our connecting However due to us arriving a bit later than scheduled time we had no gate to run into therefore waited on the runway for 20 minutes causing us to miss our connecting We were informed by the pilot that he got confirmation from the pilot that they would hold the doors The crew allowed us to get off the plane first and race and mean race to our gate Jetblue closed the doors 1 minute prior to us getting to our gate We ran to the desk however the gentlemen informed us we were too late the doors have already been closed I informed him the pilot was aware we were minutes late however he said that's too bad once the doors are closed they are closed The customer service received at the help desk was ridiculous The attendant advised us there was nothing they could do other than put us on the next flight which was scheduled for the next day I told them that was in 24 hours from now and they said we could sleep in the airport We requested to speak to a manager as we were receiving little help or support 1 hour later no manager arrived I phoned JetBlue and advised them of our situation and in turn they offered us a free stay at a nearby hotel Better than sleeping on a stiff airport chair I am writing this review so customers future customers flying with JetBlue can see the hassle my boyfriend and I went through I am thankful we received a night however if a gate would have been opened we never would have had to spend 3 hours at the airport trying to make alternative arrangements and would have enjoyed the day night paid for at the all inclusive resort Not a good way to spend your anniversary I would also like to add if you are connecting to another flight using the same airline and you are Within minutes of reaching your gate the pilots should communicate with each other Not a good experience with Jet Blue", "Washington DC to Fort Lauderdale JetBlue They made flying so simple and easy Staff was super friendly Flights were on time seats comfy plenty of leg room and they were quick to load our baggage over to baggage claim Wifi worked great on the plane you could also watch tv which I really liked I will definitely be flying JetBlue again", "Very disappointed in how fast the quality has declined with JetBlue As recent as two years ago I would have said it was the best airline in the US Flew Detroit to Boston After today I'd have to put them a grade above Spirit Inflight entertainment is primitive and outdated Flight delays seem to be a regular occurrence No USB ports to charge your devices Looks like I'll be sticking with Delta until JetBlue catches back up", "After over an hour and a half unexplained delay on a flight from Newark to Tampa we waited with absolutely no communication of any type for 30 minutes It seems based on rumors in the plane that a passenger with a dog refused to put the dog in their carrier I went up after 30 minutes asking for communication to the passengers and was ignored The flight crew kept complaining about the passenger with the dog very unprofessionally and gossiping about other flights Ground crew was particularly unprofessional", "Charleston to Boston We have been stuck at the airport now for 6 hours and still no true light in sight Looking at the Jet Blue screen there are 6 delays I wish there were more up to date on there delays We checked before leaving for the airport everything said on time Seems 20 minutes after dropping off the rental car we get the delay notice 1 hour getting updates but been here for six hours now We could have stayed in the rental and enjoyed the days instead we are sitting with about 600 customers The delay is due to a breakdown with the plane I asked at the other gates that were delayed and all stated there was a concern with the plane I guess I have no choice as I am stuck here Please stay away from airlines they do not care about your time or there delays as it not there time they are wasting I have only flown JetBlue three times 2 out of three were horrible", "JetBlue used to be good and on point but my last 3 experiences were completely unacceptable and I will never be flying with them again First flight they delayed it 4 times but it was a morning flight and I still got to my destination dealt with it 2nd flight traveling to New York canceled my flight 15 minutes before it was supposed to take off Put me on a new flight which was delayed 3 times Got to New York lost my luggage delivered it to me 2 days later completely ruined Third flight current situation convinced all friends to fly with them since I had a credit from the last experience Flight to Vegas for best friends bachelorette Had a limo waiting for us upon pick up that was paid for and bought tickets to a show as well Flight delayed four times now I called after the first time and the guy said it was due to weather so I was understanding you can't control the weather delayed the second time and the guy at the counter said it was due to the plane not leaving Havana Cuba yet Delayed a 3rd time getting pretty frustrated at this point and call again They can only say sorry Doesn't help me Then delayed a 4th time It's now not supposed to leave until 12 45AM Our entire night is cancelled and ruined I looked at the board and it looked like every Jetblue flight was delayed I promise they used to be good but they aren't anymore If you want to get to your destination on time fly with Delta American or even Spirit I would say is better now Less amenities but more reliable I'm extremely disappointed", "Chicago to Boston Did not meet my expectations JetBlue boards from the back of the plane which really sucks because I had seat 3D Boarding as quick and went okay Legroom on the E190 is amazing felt like Premium Economy on a legacy carrier The IFE was outdated but worked amazing Many channels and things to choose from The wifi is free and worked very well Now to the bad things There was only 1 flight attendant and he wasn't the best Service started late and it was done in an unprofessional manner The website said there would be snackboxes on this flight but he did not have any which was disappointing He acted uninterested in us and didn't really talk much or act happy The pilots also did not make any announcements or keep us informed at all Overall it didn't meet my expectations but it was decent and I would probably still choose them again for a future flight", "Ft Lauderdale to Boston I would like to commend our flight attendant for her professionalism politeness and perseverance dealing with a man who sat in a MORE SPACE seat that was not assigned to him She explained that he needed to either pay the extra charge for the seat or have to return to his seat He gave her a very hard time but she was really a rock star with handling him and finally the man paid the extra charge She treated him no differently than anyone else for the rest of the flight A job well done", "Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale Never again in my life The plane is at the gate but they can't find crew Suppose to leave at 8 15pm departed at 3 30am They can't find crew at Philadelphia International Can you believe it Spent the night at the airport", "We originally had a 4 hour layover scheduled in Fort Lauderdale When we arrived the Jetblue folks said we may be able to make the earlier flight but then quickly said we could not We went to the gate of the earlier flight and they said it would be a 75 per person change fee Our flight was already delayed but they would not waive the fee So now our flight is delayed 90 minutes and we will now have at least a 5 5 hour lay over because JetBlue would not give us open seats They said it is policy The reason I fly Jetblue was because I liked that they were customer friendly not like American or United This policy contradicts that belief I will not be going to Jetblue as a preferred airline anymore I hope they consider the impacts of their policy on the customer experience", "Fort Lauderdale to Jacksonville This is my first and last time ever flying with Jet Blue My flights were delayed by over an hour each way very frustrating Not choosing Southwest because of a slight montary difference for this certain route was a mistake I will be certain to never make again", "Woke up this morning to JetBlue cancelling my flight from Boston to Houston at 6 52am and blamed it on weather conditions only to put me on a flight to Dallas 30 minutes later and there be no issues Missing that flight to Houston cost me time money and possibly a job That was poor customer service on their part and blaming it on weather when the weather was fine in Houston and Dallas was ridiculous I'm sure it's all about the money as always so I would never recommend this airline to anyone", "Flew Fort Lauderdale to Barbados Seriously underwhelmed Well actually surprised by the old 18 20 years old said pilot A320 which was not clean The tiny seat screens for entertainment flickered in and out on my seat and the one next to me The service was fine think AA or Delta and we arrived on time but due to other reviews I was expecting more I usually fly Delta or AA and I see no reason to change", "Salt Lake City to Orlando From 3 49pm to 7 30pm I received multiple emails of flight delays then corrected to on time then delayed then on time then delayed from 10pm departure to 1am departure I called the airline to complain that this did not seem as a weather delay even though it was insisted multiple times that it was but as internal issues seeing as they knew the plane from NY was delayed to us by 2 hours and we kept receiving multiple changes You can track a plane on flight aware and know when it will take off and land I explained my case and the manager states so you want a refund I said I think that is fair seeing as this is clearly not a weather delay because you can track the plane that was supposed to pick us up and the airline knew since 3 49pm it was not going to make it She refunded my money but did not say anything about cancelling our tickets Maybe I am just ignorant but I thought the airline was refunding my money because they valued their clients Thankfully we realized she cancelled our tickets because the App no longer found our reservation I called back to in fact confirm with a live person a manager cancelled my reservation without telling me then had to void the refund was charged again and received our places back on the flight Now I am sitting exhausted in the airport as I write being told the flight was delayed actually by a mechanical issue Not by a flight delay from the planes previous destination as I expected all along But at least my husband and I have a ticket to board and didnt get to the airport with no reservation because the woman failed to tell me she completely cancelled our flight That would have been another aggravating battle to deal with What are we supposed to stay in Salt Lake City for the rest of our lives As far as I'm concerned every passenger should be refunded for the lies this airline has said to their customers We will never fly this airline again", "Ft Lauderdale to Chicago Very disappointed worst experience with this company Not only that our two flights were delayed by two hours and one hour but also they didn't allow us with a baby 2 months and 3 years to board earlier like preboarding which other airlines allow and also gave us tickets in the last row of the plane Never ever will fly again with them", "First time ever flying JetBlue I wasn't disappointed Even on the short 49 minute hop from Newark to Boston and at 5 30 am I might add the cabin crew and pilots were quite warm friendly and very helpful My carry on was unable to fit in the overhead bins so the FA placed my bag in an empty seat so we didn't have to gate check it Early departure and arrival pilots provided arrival gate info in the air Snack and drink service was efficient and quick Cozy leather seats albeit a bit old IFE was medicore but appreciated I plan on choosing them over United any day on this route Also mind you 49 one way ticket booked one week before departure including seat selection and snacks on board", "San Francisco to New York What an unpleasant experience I flew in on Thursday with economy plus more room seats On the way back from San Francisco's to NY the plane was maybe 30 full and mostly empty We kindly waited for everyone to board to see if the row in front of us which had a few extra inches of leg room would be vacant I am 6'3 so those extra inches would make a big difference When the plane doors closed and we were ready to roll I kindly asked the flight attendant to let me move one row up considering it was empty she immediately went on the most uncomfortable rant about extremely strict policies which isn't true I fly with JetBlue and virgin airlines only and always had very nice flight crews tell me absolutely no problem as long as no one sits here when the doors are shut feel free long story short the flight attendant was so adamant about not letting me move even though the plane was more than half empty and it was so unpleasant considering I love this airline along with virgin airline I will no longer fly JetBlue for this reason and this is all about principle Extremely uncomfortable situation to pretend like they can't move you whatsoever I will only fly virgin from now on Customer service skills are terrible", "Fort Lauderdale to Baltimore Washington This was my first time flying with JetBlue I had read many reviews about delayed flights and other inefficiencies but I wanted to experience it for myself My two flights to CTG departed on time with no issues While returning my second flight was delayed by hours The delay was due to the wrong plane being assigned I explained to the associate my concerns because I would be missing my train and would either have to spend hundreds on a hotel or almost 80 on an Uber The associate explained that nothing is in her control and that JetBlue would not be able to provide a voucher Customer service was called and they stated the same thing I ended having to get a hotel room for almost 200 and purchase another train ticket home I was told that I could send receipts but that if JetBlue decided to reimburse it would be with flight miles I haven't been this disappointed in a company in a while but I have learned my lesson I will not be flying with them in the near future", "Seattle to Charleston Very displeased I spent 400 on a one way I only spent this much because I had to be at my destination early in the day They ended up having a delay so I arrive at my overlay later than I should so I can't catch the original flight from JFK to CHS because I land three minutes after the flight leave So now I have an overlay from 7am till almost 4pm Use someone else I paid 125 for a one way American Airlines and got much beter quality", "Flew West Palm Beach to Westchester County New York Stay away from Jetblue Airways The delays on both ends of our flight due to mechanical problems were exhausting and unacceptable Our 3 10 flight is not leaving until 9 00 pm Apparently this is the usual for Jetblue The planes are filthy the flight crew rude and the TV's are broken I will never fly on this airline again", "Booked a round trip with JetBlue to depart from RDU to FLL on January 6 2018 and the flight was scheduled to depart at 7am It was delayed 2 times then cancelled We were set to start a cruise Sunday 7th and to make it on time had to book a one way with American Airlines because the quickest JetBlue could get us there was Monday which wouldn't have worked We kept the second leg of the JetBlue flight to come back to RDU and here we are today with a hour delay with the poorest customer service from the attendants at the desk I have ever witnessed This is my first time flying with JetBlue and I can definitely say it will also be my last Hope this review helps someone make a better decision on who to book with", "Ft Lauderdale to Nassau I was threatened by the gate attendant to have TSA to remove me from flight for asking why he gave my seats away that I paid extra for the man lost his mind when he was caught in a lie that he called us for passport verification we were sitting at the gate for a hour prior to boarding and never was my name called out After 5 minutes of him yelling at me for asking the question he said I better get on the plane now After turning and going 30 ' down the ramp he came running after me still waiting to yell at me There was nothing I could do but stand there in shock of what just happened So I then turned and continued the rest of the way to the plane After contacting jetblue I got no apology only offer to refund the up charge for the seats Still no credit received over 30 days after I sent complaint", "Santo Domingo to Newark Very disappointed with the service provide by JetBlue Everything started with the storm Grayson My flight was on January 4th from Santo Domingo to JFK New York That day they kept us all day updating the board with the delay flight sign to let us know at the end of the day that the flight was cancelled I was supposed to stay in The Dominican Republic for 10 days but end up staying for 15 days Calling my job everyday to keep them updated about the situation that I was going through At the end I think they didn't even believe me because every day I have to explain my boss how Jetblue couldn't find two seat to accommodate my boyfriend and I I paid for those five days out of my pocket to stay in a hotel close by the airport because every flight the put my boyfriend and I were cancelled every day for those 5 DAY My flight was supposed to be a non stop flight because I HATE to do Laid over but guess what the only flight the had available was with a laid over in ft Lauderdale I ended up traveling January 8th at 4 00am from Santo Domingo to ft Lauderdale When I was in lauderdale had to wait till 7 00pm to get another plane to Newark not being Newark my flight destination Because when I bought my flight it was from JFK to Santo Domingo straight flight and my returns was supposed to be Santo Domingo to JFK not Newark straight flight too I spent almost 24 hours to get a flight which last just 3 45hrs And the funny thing when I got to ft Lauderdale I went to one of the JetBlue representatives to asks him that please if there were an earlier flight available because I think is was ridiculous to wait 10 hours in an airport for another flight but the guys told me in order for him to do that I had to pay 75 dollars for me and 75 dollars for my boyfriend because I was trying to change the reservation that they already gave me Even thought I explain him that I had an nonstop flight but because of the situation of the storm they didn't give me any choice but to accept the laid over I end up paying almost 2 000 dollars between the hotel food and transportation from my hotel to the Santo Domingo airport and once I got to Newark I had to take a taxis to JFK parking lot because I left my car parked over there to avoid paying for taxi But at the end I had to do everything I planes not to do", "Fort Lauderdale to Raleigh Durham We received a text saying our flights have been delayed from 8 05pm to 2 10 then 2 hours later text we're back on schedule Get here and then told 2 30 am now another text 1 45 am I paid a lot of money for this ticket and you'd think you would say hey have dinner snack drink in us something We have been moved from location at least 4 times now Very upset with the lack of knowledge", "Flew New York to Puerto Plata We waited on the plane for over 3hrs waiting for a crew member I've been a true blue member for over 13 years and I have never experienced this ever I had a ceremony to attend and paid extra for my ticket to attend this event I will not be using Jetblue for future travel Unacceptable", "Booked to fly Jetblue Airways from Boston to Buffalo When the flight was cancelled due to weather the manager refused to accomodate my serious disability He wouldn't accept or even let me present my medical document proving my disability and was all around disinterested in the fact that I have this disability Apparently they cannot make accommodations for someone if a flight is cancelled due to weather even if they are legitimately disabled I am severely disappointed and disturbed Even after 2 hours on the phone with corporate they cannot do anything to accommodate my disability because it was a weather cancellation Apparently if it was cancelled another way they would have been able to How is having a documented medical disability not an accepted extenuating circumstance I am downright flabbergasted at the lack of empathy and customer service All they can provide me with is a cot of which I am larger than without pillows or blankets Without my suitable accommodations for the disability I will not be sleeping tonight Thanks for the customer disservice", "Orlando to Newburgh This is the 2nd time in 1 month of delays due to fuel part issues Have to shut plane down and reboot Needs part Same excuse on the same route Every time I have flown this airline there has been a delay But yet they proceed to publicize your great track record This airline has gone downhill in the last several years I will not fly it again", "I booked a flight from Washington to Boston Upon arriving to the airport I got an email that the flight would be delayed 15 minutes I then received a few more emails that informed me that my flight was delayed by about an hour and a half I went and got dinner at the airport where I got one email about the flight arriving a little earlier 7 54 instead of 8 09 I made plans to leave dinner to get to the gate at 7 20 where I arrived to find out my flight had left The emails that the flight was no longer delayed came in at 7 12 and I didn't see them JetBlue booked me on another flight with no charge with a layover in New York that will take much longer to get home It seems to me like emails about delays should not have been sent out if the flight was going to leave on time I am disappointed that JetBlue delays every flight I have taken with them but I am more disappointed now that I thought the flights were delayed as always and ended up missing my flight even though I arrived at the airport hours before", "New York to Mexico City via Orlando 34 hrs trip from New York to Mexico City I left my hotel in NYC at 4 30am for a 7am flight to Orlando with connection to Mexico City Due to a 4 hour delay I missed the flight in Orlando They book me for a 8 11am the next day The flight left Orlando at noon It cannot just be bad luck Putting words on planes like an airline with few delays is not enough they have to make it real with actions They are far Be careful paying less can be very expensive if you value your time", "Used to love this airline But the past few experiences have been awful Changed their policy in October so you can't get on any earlier flight no matter what without a 75 change fee even if the flight is only 60 full and you are standing at the gate and even if you are a true blue member frequent flyer and JetBlue credit card holder I am all 3 have been for almost 10 years Instead of going home I will be waiting in Fort Lauderdale airport for 4 hours where I just watched a half full flight board and take off for the same location because I won't pay 75 Not to mention the crew were confused albeit very nice though and sent me to 4 wrong locations just to inquire about the switch Used to be a great airline I am I'll be cancelling my card and switching to virgin I fly cross country a lot since I live in San Francisco and have family in Boston Very let down by the unwillingness to assist me", "We bought 3 tickets to fly round trip from San Francisco to New York Our tickets were bought with one card all together at the same time They did not give us any seat or zone number till check in When we checked in We realized ours seats are all middle seats and we were 5 row separate from each other When we inform the check in desk about the problem They replied there is nothing we can do You had the option to pay 99 99 USD individually to choose your seat I'd never choose Jetblue again in my life", "Hartford to Fort Myers I booked a flight for my elderly father while he traveled from MA to FL to be with his best friend as he passed I had called in to see what would happen if my dad either missed the flight or had to move it up just to be prepared The woman on the phone told me there would be a 100 re booking fee plus the difference in cost of the flight if there was one She also told me she'd leave a note in my file that this was something I was inquiring about Unfortunately my father's best friend passed earlier than expected and he wanted to get out of there immediately He asked me to call Jet Blue and book him a ticket for today I called again totally willing to pay the fees just to get my father home and out of a sad situation A woman on the end of the line was an absolute angel She saw the note in my file and shortly afterwards my father had a ticket booked home for day with a seat close to the front and for much lower than the originally expected cost She did not have to do this She made a really tough day a little easier on me and my father It was very very sweet and I feel compelled to write this review out of appreciation Thank you for your little gift of kindness I will pass it along", "Orlando to Los Angeles Simply do not ever use this airline Not only did they give my window seat up when I had only missed the boarding time of 6 17 by 8 minutes but once reassigned to a window seat they asked if I could get up and move one more time When I purchase a seat for this amount of money I expect my seat to be secure I didn't appreciate how easy it was for them to ask me to move If you want assured seats and friendly attendants you're coming to the wrong airline", "Flew JetBlue from Las Vegas to Long Beach After booking flight JetBlue changed the departure time significantly which left me with no option but to select a different JetBlue flight that fit my schedule for a small fee On the day of travel our flight was delayed due to maintenance problem but the ground staff did a good job of keeping us updated When I entered the aircraft it was unpleasantly warm for several minutes before AC started Once airborne the cabin cooled down and I was able to relax in comfortable seat 34 pitch and surf the web using free wifi Unfortunately my overall experience with JetBlue didn't meet the mark so I can't recommend it", "Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale First time flying with JetBlue and I was pleasantly surprised Aircraft was roomy even in economy Flight attendants were very nice and courteous I was even more surprised when they served Dunkin Donuts coffee and real snacks like pretzels and chez it's Aircraft was very clean and the flight was smooth Will definitely travel JetBlue again the fare was pretty cheap too", "Sacramento to Long Beach I did my check in online and everything went fine At the airport the flight arrived a little bit late but just 15 minutes The flight attendant was nice and we were provided water and snack complimentary The wifi was free and fast Will recommend Jetblue", "Charlotte to New York My connections to Russia was missed due to a 90 mins JetBlue flight delay in Charlotte When I used 1800 number to call for assistance JetBlue refused to give me any credit or provide me a refund for lost flights The whole trip to Russia was ruined money lost and no significant assistance provided I lost almost 800 dollars I would never recommend this airline to anyone", "Boston to Atlanta Flew through buddy pass but got bumped to next flight Family member verified with person at podium that I would be automatically transferred over to next flight Went to check in and I wasn't automatically moved over even though I was there and family member was there as well and spoke to coworker who assured him I was transferred over I am ready to blow FYI make sure you know all buddy pass rules and bug these people because they could care less about you sitting in the airport for 10 hours Horrible Customer service I wish them the same treatment in their future", "Long Beach to Las Vegas I got to the tiny airport to check in 26 minutes prior to my flight and was informed that I cannot check in for my flight because I have to be there 30 minutes prior So I missed my check in by four minutes I will not be flying jet blue again I am

experiences ever with JetBlue and will never use them again Was trying to be New York by December 7th When I bought the ticket the of departure was December 7th it state the arrival time but never told me the date of arrival It confused me at first so I called them to confirm the date of arrival which was December 8th I needed December 7th When I tried to switch the date they told me I had to pay the cancellation fee", "To start I generally travel by plane for vacation at least 2 3 times a year I've traveled all over the world and I have to say my experience on Jetblue was excellent Since JFK is 70 miles from my home I generally would not have traveled to this airport to utilize this airline but it was well worth the trip First time on Jetblue Honestly I didn't really appreciate paying 50 for arriving at the customer service desk for another flight for arriving 1 hour prior to departure but it is what it is On Tuesday Oct 24 I flew non stop from JFK to MBJ and the flight crew on Flight 479 was the best I have ever encountered Staff were courteous friendly and top notch individuals They were very personable and were generally concerned about the customers The only other flight crew I encounter this nice was EVA Air last year when traveling from Taipei to Beijing They fed me on an actual meal on a 3 hour flight I would definitely travel this airline again My traveling companion felt the same way We have traveled on at least 15 vacations together", "New York JFK to Austin I will be actively avoiding this airline from now on My gate and numerous other gates in the terminal almost exclusively jetblue were changed over and over again My flight to Austin was delayed 4 5 times by the time we actually settled at a gate These delays were 10 then 15 then 20 then 30 minute increments The staff wasn't forthcoming and said we would be boarding sooner than what my text updates were relaying There was no real communication of Why there was a delay or a realistic idea of how long the delay would actually be My first time with this line will likely also be my last", "I flew to Connecticut for a very short weekend with Jetblue Airways My flights were both delayed without enough notice for me to not have to sit an additional hour or two at the airport I since decided to use them again and booked my Christmas airfare months in advance to only find out that our flight has been changed however we were not notified My son happened to check They say that if you contact them within a short amount of time you can change your flight with no change fee except you can't get ahold of them Their system was down How convenient Not worth the hassle I fly to CT all the time and I can go without WIFI for the three hours and stick to an airline I trust like Southwest", "Flew Jetblue Airways from Orlando to Washington D C Delayed 2 hours Received many updates and changes every 30 minutes always changing delayed 30mins delayed 1hour delayed 2hours on time delayed 1 5hours delayed 2hours gate change Power went out before even taxiing out Had to wait without air for a minute when it was already hot onboard It's been a while since I've flown JetBlue I'm not impressed and will make a conscious effort not to in the near future", "San Francisco to New York JFK Positives comfortable seats accommodating flight staff Negatives Long flights should require warm meal service ticket was sold indicated as having a meal included instead had to pay over 10 for a terrible unappetizing low quality small portion meal of grey soba noodles and dried out chicken just awful No nuts for protein just salty starches for snacks Only one pass through for drinks soda water etc the entire cross country flight Worst things for flying salt and little fluids Nickle and dime you to death on JetBlue have to pay for checked bag 25 pay for blanket headset for movies etc Online check in couldn't pay for bags thus had to go through line at airport Flight delayed two hours due to JFK airport runway issues Not worth the dubious savings", "Due to fly from Orlando to Los Angeles with Jetblue Airways Been sitting here for an hour and a half waiting to for maintenance to

they'll reset the TV's but they haven't yet This truly is the worst flight I've been on I'll let you know when we leave", "New York to San Francisco in Mint Class Quick and easy check in at New York JFK on time boarding and departure The 'mini suite' seats in Mint class are fantastic Spacious comfortable and private Great entertainment options free fast wifi decent food and very good drinks Excellent cabin crew friendly and attentive Flight arrived on time Sadly my luggage didn't make it but the ground staff were very helpful and sympathetic In the end I had to travel to the airport the next day to pick up my bag which put a damper on an otherwise excellent and great value flight If my bag had arrived on time i would give them 10 10", "San Francisco to New York JFK JetBlue used to be decent but not any more Cannot even sit 2 passengers next to each other except on the very last row Then they claim imaginary JFK airport repairs are causing them to delay a flight by almost 3 hours without sending a prior email to inform us So we had to wait for 3 extra hours in the airport after checking through security because even though the flight was obviously delayed they still want you at the gate at the original boarding time how non sensical is this Any decent airline would inform their customers in advance of a delay but this is too much to ask of JetBlue Never again", "This is my first and last experience with JetBlue Today October 6 2017 my two sisters and I were booked on a direct flight from Washington to Charleston set to depart at 7 00 am We arrived at DCA timely as well as checked out bags timely We stopped to get coffee next door to our gate Gate 28 and proceeded to our gate more than 15 minutes prior to departure time only to see the gate had already closed and we were not allowed board our flight yet our luggage is on the flight There was not a courtesy page no announcement of flight boarding no final boarding announcement nothing We had to watch our flight take off in front of us This is a huge inconvenience because this delays our trip by hours because we had to rebook on another flight which gets us to Charleston at 4 56 pm versus our original arrival of 8 40am Poor customer service at its finest I wish I would have read these reviews before booking with Jetblue as I see this is quite common We couldn't even get Customer Service to comp us for the new flights we had to book even after they acknowledged their wrong doing Never again", "Raleigh Durham to Bridgetown via New York JFK Have had hands down the worst experience with jetblue ever First my flight flight 1186 was delayed 2 hours and my connecting flight ended up leaving as my flight was getting to the gate at 11pm Jetblue was unable to reroute me until the next morning at 8am They didn't comp me a hotel room and they refused to comp me anything else whatsoever Ended up getting a cot but not sleeping much Was woken up at 4 30am by a man telling me he was taking my cot Are you serious Tried asking for the man's name who flagged down an English speaking employee who called his superior and stated that was the norm yet provided no sympathy or other assistance In tears I went to the justask desk and asked if they could do anything whatsoever Nope Not even a lunchbox I didn't think customer service this bad was possible Not upset that they couldn't do anything in regards to my flights it's just that not one person said sorry or even tried to make the situation better", "New York to Montego Bay return I have been a loyal Expedia Jetblue Customer and I will never book another trip via either one of these sites again My husband and I had booked a trip to go to Montego Bay Jamaica for our honeymoon our flight was delayed multiple times without reasoning Staff members refused to elaborate the cause very cold and unprofessional Upon calling JetBlue customer service the representative failed to give any reasoning and was very unapologetic To make matters even worse we had the same experience returning to JFK I recently canceled a trip booked via Expedia due to a medical occurrence and Jetblue nor Expedia are willing to refund my money even considering the fact I purchased travel insurance in the event something beyond my control was to happen resulting in not being able to travel After playing unnecessary phone tag and speaking to many rude unsympathetic representatives along with their supervisors to no avail no one is willing to assist me It is absolutely appalling and mostly disturbing to see such a lack of compassion that has failed to be given", "New York to Los Angeles JetBlue is one of the worst airlines I've flown on I arrived for an 1130 flight at 11 16 AM because TSA took half an hour to check a single bag When I arrived at the gate and asked to go on the person there told me that they would need to find out if I could still get on the plane She disappeared and came back once the flight already left The flight ended up leaving 10 minutes early and they couldn't wait a single minute to let me on it I went to complain and the supposed customer service representative didn't care She wouldn't even look at me when I was talking When I was finished she tried to argue with me until her coworker said It's not worth arguing with him Once I did get on a later flight I was not surprised to find that they nickel and dime you for everything they even charge you for headphones seats are uncomfortable and there is no space between them", "This is my first experience with Jetblue and I have to say I am pleasantly surprised Me and my family flew from New York to San Diego and then back a week later Everything from check in to boarding was smooth and on time We enjoyed the pleasant staff the extra leg room the unlimited snacks and soft drinks also had alcoholic beverages both ways and never got charged for any We enjoyed the Direct TV on each seat and the endless list of movies We checked in a car seat for our son on way abck and we received it wrapped at JFK at no charge The flight attendant on the return flight remembered us from the inbound flight a week prior which I thought was pretty cool Overall a great experience The only downside for me was the comfort of the seats I found them a little uncomfortable", "Fort Lauderdale to Kingston I took a trip on August 8th to Jamaica checked my bags got to Jamaica my bag wasn't there they told me my bag should be there by 5pm that afternoon and give a number to call and check I call no answer However I got my bag the next day with all my clothing wet and stains and I couldn't wear anything inside the suitcase I had to pay for two seat so I can be seated with my 8 years old on the flight who is an minor when I did my son ticket I was that when I am doing my ticket all I have to do is give the customer services the confirmation from his ticket and they gone leave the seat next to him open which they did not and I had to pay for us to be seated together coming back home I feel like I was cheated", "Ft Lauderdale to Nassau I normally find their staff to be pretty friendly and accommodating for the most part but today was very special Today we thought we'd try our luck and ask to switch to an earlier flight home and got to the airport about an hour before the next available flight and explained our situation to the attendant No hesitation whatsoever Things unfortunately got a little complicated when there was a glitch in their system but staff remained patient and friendly and even called the gate to make sure it remained open for us They didn't even charge for the ticket change To top this off when we arrived at the gate the flight attendant who recognized us from our previous flight came up to say hello He asked us what seats we had and after realizing we were way in the back he immediately changed our seats to the Even More Leg Room seats without us even asking for it No charge either He even invited us to board first I appreciate these gestures that the JetBlue staff have done for me and my dad in this rather difficult time for us This review is meant to be a sort of thank you to the amazing staff I look forward to flying with JetBlue again as always", "I understand that there were issues with the route because of the storms in the Caribbean and Florida However we still landed in Fort Lauderdale and was told we will be there for 20 minutes to refuel and be catered to That message came from the Captain when we landed As I type this review it's past an hour I'm sitting here on the aircraft with other annoyed passengers without a update from the Captain as to what is happening JetBlue need to realize that communication is key and passengers need to know everything that is going on as long as it's in their interests How can it be right to be sitting on a airplane without any knowledge of what's going on time of next departure or even some kind words to comfort the passengers who would have already been at JFK from 7am to catch this flight It's now 5 17pm and I'm basically being held onboard because I was told no one will be able to disembark I would like to hear if this is standard procedure for airlines This is my first flight with JetBlue and I don't think I will be booking another", "San Francisco to Las Vegas Despite the flight leaving an hour late I still managed to have a pleasant flight Crew were great and I was also surprised that there was complementary wifi onboard Not many carriers that I've traveled on offer this amenity free If I have an option to travel within the USA I would choose JetBlue Airways", "Orlando to New York JFK On September 5 at 5 15 PM I booked a flight to be out of Florida before Hurricane Irma arrived Jet Blue accepted my reservation and payment without hesitation After all this was days before the hurricane was due to arrive 22 hours later I received an automated message telling me that my flight for today has been cancelled and that I could change it on line or call and have it changes First the flight was for tomorrow not today so I was confused I went on line Online it did not show the flight cancelled To be certain I called the 1 800 Jet Blue number The very pleasant lady who answered the call told me she would look into it but that she was actually in Orlando and no bad weather was anticipated for the day of my flight Initially she too saw that the flight was not cancelled She put me on hold checked further and said that it now showed a weather cancellation According to Weather com at the time of my flight there would be light rain and winds of 3 mph I asked if she could book me on the first available flight preceding my cancelled flight She cheerfully offered to do just that There was one 3 hours earlier was that ok Of course it was only to find out that that flight was also cancelled due to weather She checked other airports no luck And to make it more enjoyable it was being cancelled because of weather it was my problem not theirs And because they had waited another day after accepting my reservation finding another flight was more than difficult Another case of airline apathy", "New York JFK to Denver Really bad experience today 9 6 2017 on flight 97 seat 25A After sitting down it became clear the person next to be had incredibly bad breath so bad that whenever I smelt it I literally wretched Since the seatbelt sign was on I decided to wait before notifying the crew big mistake After about an hour after takeoff the seatbelt sign was still on so I pressed the call button and passed the crew member a note on my phone asking her if I could change seats She said there were middle seats available and would let me know when she came back She did come back passed my seat many times including asking for drinks but never mentioned the seat change request again even though I was visibly unable to get good air and was basically crawling out of my seat The seatbelt sign stayed on for the first 1 5 hours of the flight even though the air was calm and clear and we had long since flown out of the storms Did the pilot forget to turn it off After an hour everybody ignored it The crew member never got back to me and I was unable to change seats even though I spotted at least two other seats available That made for an extremely unpleasant four hours in the air and I will think twice before flying with JetBlue again in the future", "Detroit to Fort Lauderdale JetBlue is the worst airline experience I have ever had Upon getting stuck in traffic due to a highway pile up I still arrived at my boarding gate 11 minutes before the flight was scheduled to leave As myself and another woman approach the ramp to board They said you have to be here 20 minutes before your flight leaves to board We watch the plane sit for another 10minutes then leave I was rerouted to another flight hours later that flew into Boston With hopes of making a connection flight to Ft Laurdale Upon landing and running through Boston airport to reach a connection flight I arrived 10 minutes before the flight was scheduled to leave and they once again allowed no boarding Instead I am forced to wait 5 more hours on another flight One of my vacation days is a total waste This has been the worse flying experience of my life This is my first and last time flying with JetBlue", "New York JFK to Syracuse I have flown Jet Blue on and off since it first came into existence Over the last 10 years my trips have primarily been to destinations that Jet Blue doesn't cover but a flight to Syracuse took me back into their flight paths I was very pleased on my outbound flight to find them just the same and more legroom than I get on international flights But what made this trip better is that I needed a change in my non changeable flight due to a family emergency and was pretty distraught on the phone The person assisting me was professional and comforting and took care of getting me on the best flight to get me home and made a hard trip far far easier My typical flights are still outside the Jet Blue coverage areas so I can't fly them as often as I would like after this experience hoping this review makes up for that Thank you for your kindness at a difficult time", "My first and probably last time flying Jetblue Outbound from O'Hare to JFK we left over 30 minutes late and yet made an on time arrival How was that even possible Pad your flight schedules much On the way home we pulled back only a few minutes late but then pulled over and waited on the tarmac for an hour an half Although we were told that there was weather in between New York and Chicago passengers got on their phones and found that the weather radar was completely clear No storms at all Crew members just gave sheepish grins when told this information We then had to return to the gate so that a new crew could take over Passengers were allowed to deplane with all of their things and told that they could buy food and then reboard After another hour or so all of us including those who had already boarded the plane twice were forced off into the terminal with all of our stuff Five hours after the original departure time we finally reboarded some passengers for the third time and eventually took off The entertainment system cut in and out the entire trip going dark for ten minutes at a time There were no apologies given for that problem or the delays just a passing thank you for your patience before the final re re boarding The crew members were pleasant throughout the ordeal but they work for a complete joke of an airline If I were New York I would force it to remove the New York's Airline advertising that is up around town to avoid guilt by association", "Boston to Cleveland Jetblue surprises me as a low cost airline The staffs were professional and courteous I ordered two little bottles of white wine and normally they would charge for it but the attendant on my flight just said to me don't worry about the payment enjoy your wine first I will come back later and he never came back to charge me And I don't think anyone was charged for his drinks On top of that eveyone has a screen in front him her to watch DirectTV or if the flight is more than two hours free movies The Wifi on the flight was also free if you are a member of Jetblue s frequent flyer program I would definitely keep Jetblue in mind when flying US domestic flights in the future", "Raleigh Durham to Boston I've been flying since August 18th since 4pm they cancelled my flight the same day I was traveling when I called they said yes ma'am this happens all the time I understand this part but your job is look for another flight way before I called They made me fly from the Raleigh airport to Boston to get with the surprise that as soon as I got to Boston I found out that my connecting flight to NY got delayed and I won't make it to my final destination So I go over there trying for them to find me a new flight so I could make it on time and there was none she told me I had to stay overnight and catch the next flight the next day at 12pm I did that I went to my gate and I slept there Then someone from the airport woke me up and told me I couldn't sleep there and I had to go outside They cancelled my flight and are kicking me out Worst airline to fly with to be honest", "Boston to Baltimore I bought a flight weeks ago for a 9 30 pm departure time The flight was delayed initially by 25 minutes then 1 hour another hour and then another 40 minutes The latest delay is a further 1 hour 15 minutes As I am sitting here writing this review 6 hours after arriving to the airport for my original flight with no end in sight and I seriously will never fly JetBlue again I have taken some shady flights in my day Spirit RyanAir etc but all of them are preferable to experience I had tonight Congratulations in exactly one booking you have ruined the entire JetBlue brand and that's pretty impressive", "Worst experience ever We were supposed to leave Fort Lauderdale to Nassau at 1 pm and Jetblue kept posponing the flight They made us move from one gate to another one then back to the initial one Nobody had a straight answer Am I gonna get back my vacation day And my kids's one First and last time", "Orlando to Newark I booked with JetBlue because I thought it would make my flying experience so much smoother But on multiple occasions they have made it an absolute nightmare Upon flying to Costa Rica my flight was scheduled to depart at 8 AM They delayed it an hour at a time over seven times and then they completely cancelled the flight at 2PM There were no other flights from JetBlue until the next day meaning most of us lost money on hotels shuttles and time wasted They did not give me a credit for the time lost they just partially refunded me for the ticket since I was also coming back from Costa Rica flying JetBlue I am now in Orlando trying to get back home to New Jersey and the same nightmare is happening again They delayed it by an hour and a half Now they've delayed it by another 45 minutes They are notorious for great customer service if you can actually make it on the plane I have never had such an absolutely awful experience and this has happened to me twice within a two week period at two separate airports Do not ever book with them unless you want your time wasted and nothing from them as an apology I paid over 800 several months in advance", "San Jose to Orlando My flight scheduled from 8AM was first delayed until 9AM Then 9 to 9 30 Then 9 30 to 10 Then 10 to 11 Then 11 to 12 30PM Then 12 30 to 1 Then after waiting several hours in the airport since I got there two hours before you depart 6AM they cancelled the flight and said there were no more until the following day I had a shuttle to catch in the morning and it cost 350 to reschedule the shuttle because I was traveling five hours away from the airport If they had just cancelled it to begin with I could have booked with another airline to make it there on time I ended up going to a completely different airport and flying with United who bumped me to first class I made it to Costa Rica on time because of them JetBlue gave me more than a headache it was an absolute disaster of a travel experience a nightmare and they offered no compensation other than a refund They randomly booked me on another flight that I never asked for I was booking with another airline who could get me there on time and I had to spend over an hour on the phone with a JetBlue agent to reimburse me the money properly I am now returning with JetBlue and the delays have begun again We are already an hour and forty minutes into the delay Do yourself a favor and don't fly JetBlue", "Wish I had seen these Jetblue reviews before booking So many people have my exact experience my connecting flight from San Juan to Orlando was cancelled on August 12th They could not get my 3 family members on a flight until Tuesday the 15th We settled for a flight to Ft Lauderdale on the 13th paying to rent a car for the drive to the Orlando airport This flight has now been delayed three times and I am waiting for the cancellation There is no customer service they offer little to nothing to assist in getting you back to the city for which you purchased a ticket", "Fort Lauderdale to Lima Wifi didn't work and then the TVs broke on my entire row We were issued a service credit of 15 however this is unable to be used on already booked flights ie our return leg a month later After discussing this with the service department I was transferred to a very rude and unhelpful surpervisor She would not allow me to use this credit for my future flight as it was booked before the malfunction took place as that's not how it works If I could cancel my upcoming flight for a full refund and book with another airline I would Will never fly with them again because of their poor customer service and malfunctioning equipment", "On my way home from Cancun to Boston via Fort Lauderdale with Jetblue Traveling with my whole family we have spent from 10 30am traveling to a destination that's only 5 hours away Arrival time now delayed to 2 30 in the morning Traveled almost 24 hours I will never fly Jetblue and I would never recomend to anyone I am literally transferring my balance and canceling my Jetblue card asap Anyone who sees this review please think twice before booking It's now 7pm and our flight leaves at 11 and we get home at 2 30am worst traveling experience ever Would recomend flying with another airline first", "Richmond to Punta Cana via Fort Lauderdale Boston Just perused recent reviews and feel like my story was already told Numerous times Worst trip ever coming and going Left Richmond VA for Punta Cana DR via Fort Lauderdale on Aug 3 #645 #173 2 5 hour delay from FL because apparently Jetblue neglected to assign a pilot to the flight Called Jetblue from terminal and was informed that I must have misunderstood gate employee as no one from Jetblue would ever make such an announcement re the lack of a pilot I explained to rep that we were meeting group from NY in DR to share hour transport to hotel that had already been paid for Rep went on to explain they would need at least 5 days to evaluate who was at fault for the delay of a flight with no pilot assigned and to call back at that time to see if we would be compensated Needless to say we had to pay another 70 00 for transport to hotel Return trip From Punta Cana DR to Boston #896 for lay over then on to Richmond VA #1281 Left DR at 12 48 with 5 00 arrival time in Boston to catch a 6 50 connection to Richmond When we were still in the air at 5 15 expressed concern to flight attendant that we would be unable to get through customs and traverse the entire airport in what was looking like less than an hour We were assured we would have no problem Landed and got off plane about 5 35 flew through terminal begging anyone who would listen customs Jetblue employees TSA etc that we had a connecting flight They couldn't care less Even had Jetblue employee send us in the totally wrong direction dragging 3 suitcases which probably cost us at least 15 precious minutes Thank God for the other passengers on TSA line who let us cut to front My poor husband got through 1st and went flying to gate to beg that they await our arrival only to discover flight had already closed doors at 6 35 First we were told there was another flight to Richmond at 7 00 Then we were informed that was a mistake the next was at 9 00 pm Asked to speak with supervisor who was only interested in the specifics of our flight times and then informed us that the problem was with whomever booked our flight as Jetblue always recommends at least 2 hours between connecting flights to avoid exactly what we just went through When we informed him we had booked the entire trip through Jetblue Vacations and shouldn't his airline know their own policy he had nothing to say In the middle of exchange another employee came over whispered in his ear and and he took off no explanation After waiting 20 minutes because of course the supervisor of an airline in the middle of hearing a complaint from one of their customers would return we went looking for him Found him behind a counter talking to another employee Watched for about 5 10 minutes until he turned around and saw me This guy had no intention of returning to finish our conversation So long story short we got a 40 voucher for food which in airline ese is 2 hamburgers found out our luggage had somehow made the very flight we missed and got home to Richmond at midnight Note Flight crew on #381 were fabulous as was unknown employee at Logan check in counter who somehow got our liquor boxed and on flight after another Jetblue employee gave us the totally wrong info on how to transport", "Jetblue flight from Providence to Orlando due to leave at 630p but delayed twice due to plane maintenance per service desk attendant Plane is currently in Fort Lauderdale being serviced We booked a direct flight because I have back problems and can't handle long layovers need place to lay down First day of our vacation long overdue ruined due to Jetblue Wondering if we will be stuck here overnight and have to wait all day tomorrow too", "Cleveland to Fort Lauderdale return I would like to thank JetBlue for making our travel a little bit easier our flight was delayed for hours and we had three children first time flying for them They let my children go into the cockpit and look around this was awesome for them We had a nice flight when we departed from Fort Lauderdale we got held up in security due to my youngest daughter leaving a tablet in her bag that I forgot to take out a representative from jetblue came and took my husband and three children to the gate to board and came back got my bag and rushed me to the gate Thank you jetblue for making sure my family came home together", "Terrible delay from New York JFK to Orlando three hours with no weather issues Zero communication Unfriendly Jetblue staff that lied and dodged questions Staff members continually told us they knew nothing about our flight and that they weren't working the flight yet all if them were our crew upon boarding Zero accommodation Upon landing they disappeared We were directed by Jetblue staff with no verbal conversation but hand motions shuffling us from one place to the next only to end up in the completely opposite part of the airport for bag claim with our entire fellow passengers Over 100 people had to reroute across whole airport due to their lack of care after a three hour delay", "Orlando to Newark I flew by jetblue many times in last 6 month 90 of the times my flight was delayed It was not like small delay but overnight delays It is pathetic They give credit of 75 this credit can be used only on jetblue flights What is the use I dont want to travel by their airline anymore They dont care about customers Time and energy wasted during these delays are priceless I have missed important meetings because of these delays They give weather reasons every time When every other airline is on time", "Ft Lauderdale to Boston Traveling back from Florida with my wife and two young daughters Jetblue sent me an email at 7 47am 3 hours before my flight 2020 FLL Worcester was scheduled to take off at 11 06am that our flight was canceled Agents on the phone were no help only offering a flight leaving at 9 25am as an option They claimed the flight was canceled for mechanical issues somehow I don't believe that and this was some sort of cost saving cancellation We rushed to the airport for the 9 25am flight only to be met by bumbling ticket agents who couldn't process customers quick enough When it was out turn we were locked out After running in between terminals we were re booked on Flight 376 to Philadelphia with a connection to Boston yes not our original destination Flight 376 which was scheduled to depart at 1 32pm was a fiasco from the start The flight boarded all passengers only to tell us that we'd be delayed as the flight had no water so they needed to wait for hand sanitizer this wait was over 40 minutes Stormy weather blew in the runway was closed and we missed the window After several openings and closings of the runway we finally took off at 3 30pm 2 hours after our scheduled departure The late takeoff meant we would cut it very close for our connecting flight 660 out of Philadelphia for Boston I received a notification on my phone that the flight had been delayed till 6pm With our estimated arrival in Philadelphia of 5 45pm I was hoping we'd be able to just make it I asked the stewardess to speak with the captain as there were around 15 of us that had our Worcester flight 2020 canceled and were rebooked on these flights I dreaded the thought of missing my connection because of the plane's lack of water and need for a hand sanitizer delivery that took 40 minutes The stewardess returned and said she spoke with the captain who would try to hold the flight About 10 minutes before our landing another stewardess went on the intercom and told all theBoston bound passengers to relax because our gate was right next to Boston flight 660's E2 and that the plane would wait for us as the captain had called ahead That was a major relief to hear that news She also explained that we'd be let off the plane first ahead of other passengers to expedite our plane change This was also a relief to hear considering my carry ons and precious kid cargo I nearly texted my father to pick us up at Logan he was driving from N Grafton in Worcester county but I hesitated wanting to be 100 sure Well unfortunately my apprehension proved deserved When the door to the plane opened there wasn't any parting of the seas to let us through In fact both stewardesses who communicated with us disappeared presumably shying away from the hidden truth I yelled aloud whether we were being let off first but no one replied I then looked out the plane's window there wasn't any plane at E2 flight 660 had already taken off I walked down the gate corridor completely bewildered the crew members were still nowhere to be seen Upon exiting the gate the JetBlue ticket agent handed me a new set of tickets I asked where flight 660 went The agent replied that it had taken off at 5 47 13 minutes ahead of schedule and that we were now rebooked on the 8 41pm flight 760 Needless to say all Boston bound passengers were furious not sure if I can fly Jetblue for a while", "Chicago to Boston I was supposed to leave at 7 10 pm on a Thursday night The flight continued to get delayed until 1am They finally told us the flight was canceled Then we waited for an hour to get booked on an 11am flight for Friday morning The exact quote was we guarentee you will be booked on the 11am flight I am now at the airport at 10am and our flight has been pushed back to 4 45pm This airline consistently gave no information and was extremely reactive with no helpful options They gave us a 250 voucher but who wants a voucher for an airline that treats customers like this and their flights can't take off on time This will be the first and last time I ever fly Jetblue Disclaimer these delays were all under control of the airline Twice we've been told flight was delayed due to pilot running out of legal hours This is in control of a business as you know how long your pilots fly and they still promised us times for flights that were unrealistic", "Second time and last time flying Jetblue Airways from Port au Prince to Pittsburgh via Ft Lauderdale Booked this flight because I had a 50 credit from my first disaster with this airline I really hesitated booking this flight but thought I would give them a second chance They proved to be the same disastrous mess they were the first time Sitting in Ft Lauderdale airport 3 hours delayed on the floor because there are Jetblue delayed customers everywhere Over 90 of all outgoing and incoming Jetblue flights on the screen are delayed The weather here is perfect not the cause of the problem Let me add all shops and restaurants in this terminal close at 9pm We are stuck here till 11 30 unless Jet Blue changes that for the 6th time today and not even one offer of food or snacks from Jet Blue This was not worth the 50 I saved Really need to get their act together", "New York to Ft Lauderdale One more time JetBlue becomes a nightmare re delays customer service and total flight quality Flight delayed 4 hours with no reason Also customer service at help desk is unimanagible horrible and very helpless Jet Blue should start pay attention regarding regular daily customers I feel disapointed again by trusting Jet Blue", "They will never tell you the truth For this flight from Bogota to Fort Lauderdale with Jetblue we've been in the airport for almost 6 hours We boarded the plane and after 2 hours we were advised it would be taken to a hangar 2 hours later we were told we would return to the airport for food After 1 5 hours in line we got some horrible food No information from the airline after 6 hours What I see is many passengers that are already in their second delay because of the same issue It seems it is the way it works There is no one to speak to just write an email and wait for response which can take one month", "Jetblue flight from New York to Fort Lauderdale was scheduled for 9 37 once I got to check in 6 50 the flight was delayed no gate no time info I received email after email with updates for the flight being more and more delayed my family

Orlando to Bogota was delayed from 7 pm to 1 am for technical difficulties Later on the changed it to 4 00 am 9 hours of delay 3h before The left us waiting at the airport for 12 hours No solutions proposed from the staff who were rude They just said if cancel you have to wait 2 days to get to Colombia For food boxes with chips and cookies Really bad experience It was inhuman Cheap company I will never travel with Jetblue again", "New York to Seattle with Jetblue General trend is that most staff members airport and flight attendants are rude and have big attitudes Customer care is the last thing they know The flight attendant showed zero patience and didn't wait for 5 seconds on my drink order She said she will comeback to take order and never did We were family of 4 and our seats were scattered all over When we requested to be seated together they said the flight is completely full and they can't do it However there were empty seats throughout JetBlue will be my last choice when I book my next travel", "Had a stopover in Boston coming from Lisbon to Washington DC Stopover was originally 5 hours but bad weather ended up making it 7 A lot of the flights were getting cancelled to Washington so lots of people were trying to get standby on mine I ended up hanging out in the corner near the gate's counter for about 5 hours watching the Jetblue employees work They seemed to be very friendly and accommodating with the flyers and I imagine it was very stressful After sitting in the corner for 5 hours one of the Jetblue employees asked to see my ticket and put me in a much better premium seat and allowed me to board first because he felt bad I had spent so many hours at the gate The flight and crew was also great I've flown Jetblue only a few times but have yet to experience an unpleasant experience", "Fort Lauderdale to Medellin Jet Blue has figured out a way to cut costs Quite often you will find that their flights are delayed due to maintenance that they do to the plane before departure In the last two flights I have taken with them one flight was delayed three times making me lose my connecting flight and forcing me to fly out next day The second time it is delayed because they are working on the plane This is the last time I will fly this airline", "Washington to Boston This airline is fine should you not actually want to go anywhere I felt like I was in kindergarten with a make believe airline I booked through Emirates Foolish me instead of booking a direct flight out of IAD with Emirates I thought to save several hundred dollars by booking a cheaper flight with connecting JetBlue flights through BOS and JFK Big mistake I should have paid the premium for an Emirates only booking and completely avoid JetBlue Flight staff have the friendliness but incompetence of high school interns Weather delay I understand I drove through the rainstorm At the check in counter I specifically asked the staff at the counter if I would make my connecting flight to Emirates in BOS He responded that the connection was tight but good Wrong At the gate just before boarding I and four other people were informed that we would miss our connections and needed interline tickets The staff at the gate spent an hour on the phone getting interline tickets for the other four passengers and when she got to me then after another twenty minutes on the phone she informed me that I had just missed an interline ticket with Qatar Airways by fifteen minutes and could only go the next day a loss of 24 hours for me She talked to me in the nicest department store customer service voice but was incompetent I missed a whole day on my vacation JetBlue should have booked the interline ticket immediately at the check in counter when they had told me that the connection to my Emirates flight out of BOS was tight Returning connection JFK to IAD I landed at JFK timely with Emirates and put my checked bag on the connections check in counter and proceeded to JetBlue Terminal I saw on the Departures Board that my connecting JetBlue flight from JFK to IAD was several hours away but that there was an earlier JetBlue flight I asked the staff at the Help Desk if I could get a boarding pass for the earlier flight He asked me if I had a checked bag and I replied that I already had checked in my bag at the transfer connecting flights counter And so then he said that no I couldn't get an earlier flight because my bag was already checked in for the later flight and was going to be on that flight Okay fine I understand So I took my originally booked flight my first actual flight on a JetBlue aircraft which took off about two hours late being a small discount aircraft flight at the very end of the day I kind of understand that Upon arrival at IAD I looked and looked for my checked bag at Carousel 10 After many bags went by I looked around the carousel and saw my bag sitting inside the JetBlue baggage office It had come on the earlier flight So here I am at Dulles at two o'clock in the morning with my bag calling for my pickup ride when I could have been calling for my pickup ride at a more civilized hour in the early evening I specifically asked the staff at the gate if food would be provided onboard the aircraft I was told no So I stocked up on some snacks at the nearby snack kiosk Needless I was served cookies and Sprite onboard I shall never book JetBlue again", "I have been delayed 5 times thus far on my trip from Raleigh to Montego Bay via Fort Lauderdale I am highly disappointed in this long delay in my vacation This is my first and last time flying Jetblue I have lost money on my room at the resort thanks to the airline", "I had 3 delays leaving Boston and then for my return flight I received an email that my flight was canceled Soon an automated voicemail and email reported a next day new flight However I had planned to fly out after a conference and had no reservation to stay in PA I called customer service who told me to go to the airport to talk with someone at the Jetblue Kiosk who might be able to offer some compensation I asked for clarification you are telling me to pay to travel to the airport where you have already notified me that my flight is canceled to possibly offer me compensation Yes the rep offers I am horrified what if this was my daughter flying What would she do in a city by herself without a hotel I checked the website and entered my flight info no compensation Thankfully I did not spend 60 getting to the airport to learn this Unacceptable", "New York to Seattle The incompetence and lack of ownership from JetBlue's side astounds me I am unlikely to ever fly this airline again From my flight being cancelled Flight 263 to them loosing my luggage and blaming everyone else Emirates Me Customs etc but themselves to their inundated Customer Service people spending 30 to 60 minutes on the phone per customer to attempt to get them on other flights I spent almost 6 hours at JFK figuring out what I needed to do as their customer service representatives were so unhelpful and made almost no announcements to anyone to let us know what was actually going on I stood in one line for 2 hours and then another for another 2 hours and at no point were we given any clear guidance as to what was actually happening Once I finally got a ticket out of New York for 2 days after the cancelled flight I was told that JetBlue would not cover accommodation due to the flight being cancelled on account on bad weather There was no bad weather in New York at the time that we arrived or the time the flight was supposed to depart I spoke to several passengers who were all going to very different destinations Seattle Charleston Boston etc and all flights were cancelled which tells me that the weather issue was not the destination or on route it was the source New York and seeing that there was actually no rain an just some clouds it seems ludicrous that they would have us believe that the flights were cancelled due to bad weather The fact that these sorts of things must happen every day so for me to spend 6 hours in a airport sorting everything from flights to accommodation to taxis to my lost luggage which up to today no one had logged a ticket for is absolutely unacceptable and it boggles my mind that they are still operating with this level of inefficiency lack of procedure and incompetence", "My flight was cancelled today from New York to Seattle I have been waiting in the customer service line for over an hour to find out what my next steps are The staff have been absolutely useless and insanely slow They are taking so unacceptably long to turn over customers Some of the same people are still waiting at the service counter This will undoubtedly be the last time I use this airline again", "Long Beach to Austin What has happened to JetBlue It used to be our go to airline to fly into Orange County Three flights over the course of the past two weeks have resulted in 2 hour delays for two of the flights and a missing crew for the other flight resulting in a 1 hour delay Will look for alternate airlines from here on out", "We were trying to fly by JetBlue flight 1752 yesterday to Nantucket from Boston Flight has been delayed due to weather conditions and finally canceled and we have been rebooked to connecting flights via JFK so will spend whole day flying No compensation Killed Saturday The irony is there were many flights same day which successfully taken off from Boston and landed in Nantucket same time with canceled JB flight Not been stopped by weather Looks like when you are JetBlue and have a lot of free seats next day on others flights nothing prevents to cancel a flight and save a lot of money no matter what plans people have From other review here it seems I am not alone and frequent flights cancellation from JetBlue is common practice so avoid flying them unless you have no other option or have plenty of free time and money", "Daytona Beach to New York I bought two tickets One was for me and the other was for my son For some reason my son was not able to travel with me but I still kept the ticket and checked in for him Since I paid for the ticket I wanted to keep the seat vacant for more space When I was boarding at the gate Jetblue staff took my son's boarding pass away from me She said that since my son was not boarding Jetblue needed to have the boarding pass back and to remove my son from the flight customer list I asked if Jetblue would give the seat to the others The Jetblue staff said that they can and that's how it work I was surprised of the information Nevertheless the seat of my son was left open today because they didn't need it the staff told me", "New York to Buffalo via Boston Jetblue thoroughly disappointed me over the Holiday Weekend I was supposed to go home on June 30th at 10 30 pm out of JFK but that did not happen My flight was delayed for hours until they finally cancelled it Not only did the support team have no remorse or sympathy the only flight they could get me on was the next day at 8 am which had a 5 hour layover in Boston and wouldn't get to Buffalo until the next day at 8 pm I had no guarantee I would not get stuck in Boston the next day My trip was cancelled I was stranded at New York JFK at 3 in the morning with no way to get home but spend 100 on an Uber back to my home in Jersey I was inconvenienced exhausted and upset I waited in the customer service line for two hours only for their support team to tell me they could not refund me I was finally refunded the next day after waiting on hold for an hour It was not weather it was that this airline could not handle the magnitude of flights booked for the Holiday Weekend and did not have enough Pilots Maybe if the customer service team was a bit more caring efficient and helpful I would consider flying with Jet Blue but not even one ounce of remorse or care that shows me how valued we are as customers", "Based on my experiences of 6 22 2017 and 6 24 2017 I will never purchase another fare from JetBlue and I will never recommend them to anyone In the spring I began making plans to attend my daughters graduation from grad school in Vermont Using Expedia I searched for a reasonable fare and decided on JetBlue The fares I purchased included a flight from O'Hare to JFK with a short layover at JFK and then a flight to Vermont The same package in reverse was available for us three days later when we wanted to return home So in all I purchased three fares one for myself my husband and youngest daughter and altogether we were scheduled for two flights to get to Vermont and two flights to return to Chicago On the drive into O'Hare on the morning of 6 22 2017 I received a text message that the flight to JFK and then the connecting flight to Vermont had been cancelled There was no reasonable explanation given Here were all my hopes of getting to Vermont cancelled in a brief cold text message I called Expedia who helped me arrange for another flight to Burlington but they also told me to keep the flight with JetBlue for my return flight on 6 24 2017 as they hadn't cancelled those two flights Bad idea I should of cancelled it and made changes right then but I thought this kind of event was something unusual On Saturday 6 24 2017 when we went to the airport in Vermont to depart the JetBlue flight was delayed for around four hours JetBlue arranged for us to get a later connecting flight to Chicago that was suppose to leave around 6 00 When we got to JFK the flight to Chicago was on the board and it said on time I think we may have been there an hour or so and suddenly the status of the flight was changed to cancelled Again we got no answers or help from JetBlue's customer service with the exception of telling us where we could pick up our checked bag in the airport and rescheduling a plane the next day that we later learned would supposedly leave some time around 2 00 in afternoon and get us home by 9 30 after two connecting flights Fearing we would be stranded in yet another city we made other arrangements Essentially we were left stranded at JFK by JetBlue There were no available hotel rooms this weekend as it was Pride weekend in New York City and all the hotels were booked We searched for rooms Expedia searched for us and after using the services at JFK we learned there was nothing available We were given no help or direction from JetBlue that was meaningful or helpful in our situation We had never been to New York and only expected our stay to be a brief one as a connecting flight No room no reciprocity with another carrier So to be clear three out of the four flights we had arranged months in advance were cancelled by JetBlue with just the flick of a text message I will never fly JetBlue ever again I am utterly appalled for what passed as service and the willingness to leave people stranded with no assistance There are few words to describe the service we received from JetBlue over this weekend but it was punctuated with an attitude of aww too bad and your on your own I would like to thank the people who did help us at JFK but they were were from a different carrier who actually got us home the next morning", "Our 8 45 pm Jetblue flight departed Fort Lauderdale FL at 9 32 pm and landed in Detroit airport at 12 20 am Scheduled at 11 44 pm We were stuck in front of the gate for 1 hour because the gate crews were not there That is ridiculous If they can't keep enough ground crew why they are in business They don't have any right to play with customers' valuable time", "Scheduled to fly Jetblue Airways from Long Beach to Las Vegas I will never fly with this airline again been waiting two hours for a flight to Vegas and you can't get any updates or assistance from employees I could have driven to my destination by now I'm still waiting to board I would not recommend anyone fly with them", "San Jose to Boston The flight was delayed for 6 hours and then they cancelled the flight because they could not find a cabin crew to work that flight after all the delays The customer service was not very accommodating during this whole situation They had overbooked the flight but that was avoided altogether because they ended up cancelling the flight after making people wait for a 6 hours They did not want to refund or rebook and all I had spent on the flight is gone The frontdesk person was also not as helpful granted people's tempers were already fuming after not being given ample communication beforehand that the flight might get cancelled and having been made to wait for 6 hours during the wee hours of the night I ended up missing all the important appointments planned as a result of this incident I will never fly JetBlue again", "Flew from Burlington to Seattle via New York JFK I will never fly Jetblue Airways again My flight here was first delayed by four hours Then my return flight was delayed by two hours because they held a plane for another group from another city causing me to miss my connection It seems this airline can't keep its schedule even remotely I'm losing an entire day because they ran some numbers and figured it was easier to screw the smaller number of flyers I'll pay a little extra to fly with airlines I can trust like Alaska Air", "Multiple delays of 2 3 hours on both flights leaving on 6 16 and returning on 6 25 flying from Orlando to Newark Maintenance issues As the gate number also kept changing we could see many other JetBlue flights were delayed Really disappointing Won't be flying with Jetblue again", "Boston to Philadelphia The airport staff that helped me with booking of my flight was helpful I requested an earlier flight instead of the stated flight time that was given to me in Lisbon and the staff did everything to get me on board with the earlier time I would give 5 star for this service", "Boston to Fort Myers First flight was cancelled 3 hours before departure with no other flight options that day Had to leave in the evening the following day and that flight was delayed 2 hours An entire 24 hours of vacation lost forever Return flight was delayed an hour Weather was clear both days at our airport as well as the airport the plane was coming from This errand I could care less about your time they just want your money", "JetBlue is the worst airline first time flying this company from Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas and everything went wrong First 3 gate changes 2 hours to get on the plane through the rudest gate staff you can imagine Once on as we taxi the pilot says there's thunder while other planes take off then half an hour after it turns out to be a mechanical problem they are going to try to fix Please see attached picture for the riveting entertainment and the wifi doesn't work either", "Flew Jetblue from Portland to Anchorage Customer service was horrible at the ticket counter We were traveling with someone with a wheelchair and the staff member gave us the wrong information After waiting for four hours she told my husband he could go right to baggage drop and they refused to assist him and sent him to the end of the line Not helpful at all Not sure what happened last year they had excellent service and this year it has gone downhill This is the second time we have flown this summer", "I always fly JetBlue every time there is always exceptional service provided From Santo Domingo to New York JFK the flight attendant onboard was super friendly and helpful and made this flight very pleasant and enjoyable Thank you Jetblue for always providing such outstanding service Will continue to fly with this airline", "New York to Jacksonville First flight delayed so we missed the second Still waiting 2nd flight that's been delayed twice Probably will be spending the night at JFK for reasons no one will share with us I would like to rate them zero One thing's for sure JetBlue will never screw me again", "Charlotte to Boston JetBlue is a good carrier if you fly to and from a JetBlue hub If not I would not fly on this airline 100 of my direct flights from Charlotte to Boston return have been either late or canceled In all cases it was important for me to get to my destination on time JetBlue tends to be slightly better priced than American on these routes but I have concluded it just isn't worth the 25 35 savings", "Thought that I'd try Jetblue for the first time when they posted the cheapest flight for the first time in the 3 years I've been flying between San Antonio Austin and New York In the end I've come to the conclusion as I'm waiting overnight in the JFK terminal for 8 hours that they really just don't care I originally scheduled travel to leave on the evening of 25 May but I was informed that the flight would be delayed out of Austin for 3 hrs and as a result would miss my connection at JFK The earliest they'd be able to get me out of JFK on the 26th would be 4pm so I changed my flight to depart Austin on the 26th The same flight on the 26th was again delayed from 5 06pm to 5 50 pm and I called to ensure that I would still make my connection The phone agent confirmed I would make the connection so I drove to Austin to catch my flight While waiting at the gate the flight was delayed again now to 6 25pm Attendant at the gate confirmed that I would make my connection As I was boarding the plane I was told that I'd have to check my carry on I explained that I had a tight connection in JFK but was reassured by the gate that it wouldn't be a problem As we approached JFK the flight had to circle until we were diverted to refuel in Philly for return to JFK Once we finally landed at JFK it was 12 30am and thought I would have time to catch my connecting flight however no one from Jetblue met the plane and the crew did not provide connection information I looked at the departure boards but my flight was not listed As I attempted in vain to search the gates for my departing flight and access the flight status option on the website which did not work I went to the previous gate I was told the flight would be at before it had been delayed several times but it was not there and the only manned Just Ask station in the terminal was in close proximity but with twenty people in line So I called the 1 800 number and it was obvious that the phone agent was not well trained and tried to inform me that my next flight was my departure flight on the 29th and all my previous flights had departed on time She had no idea that my flights had been delayed and informed me that the only available flight was 8 36am that morning I asked then why had I received texts that my connecting flight was not departing until 01 07am and she couldn't explain it but asked if I wanted to change my flight as if I had a choice When I said yes she stated that she would have to get a supervisor to allow her to make the change That process took about 30 minutes and at the conclusion she told me that I needed to talk to an employee at the terminal to confirm the information she'd provided me When I finally got to the front I was told that the flight had indeed been delayed and that I could have caught that flight and my bag had made it on the flight Why wouldn't the flight be on the departure screens So now I have no access to my bag during the 8 hour layover To top it off I requested to talk to a supervisor and was told that someone would come talk to me but it could take a while I have 8 hours to spend here anyway so said sure I'll wait Two hours later I was told that the supervisor would not be able to speak with me and that if I truly wanted to speak with one that I would need to exit security and search for one at the ticket counter Had I known I would have canceled my travel plans First and last time I'll fly on Jetblue", "I have had two very unpleasant experiences with JetBlue recently Lost baggage Significant delays and missed connection to desired airport Had to reroute to another airport In regards to the first unpleasant experience lost baggage Luggage never left JFK airport my departure airport My ultimate destination was La Paz Bolivia with a connection to Washington IAD from New York JFK Representative sent me to the incorrect terminal after I was already at the correct terminal Terminal 5 This already caused a stressful situation Secondly upon my arrival my bags did not arrive to my final destination La Paz The second awful experience was due to a severe delay and missed connection Once again JetBlue I've already spent enough time writing complaints I would prefer not to anymore Avoid at all costs", "Los Angeles to New York Today was my 10th flight with JetBlue Boarding was fast and efficient 30 minutes after takeoff water bottles were handed out orders taken for soft drinks and snacks handed out later on The leg room was very good for this 5 5 hour leg I purchased a cheese and cracker box for 9 which was amazing as well as a few drinks An hour before landing crew members passed by with water bottles again The downside on the A321 is that the remote on the seat is in the middle of the armrest and I kept on accidentally hitting the volume I had to fiddle a little with the head phone jack Wi Fi worked perfectly throughout the flight and it was free All the flight attendants were more than friendly", "Orlando to Cancun Have flown to Cancun several times and the flight has never been less than 3 hrs late with jetblue Their service and explanation as to why they are late is horrible It appeared they claim it's an equipment problem when really it's lack of tickets sold and they want to move people to later flight", "Tampa to Hartford Check in was efficient and orderly We flew with a all male crew The announcer was amusing informative and entertaining It was a pleasant change Service was great and made it a lot easier to deal with the hollering toddler Good job JetBlue", "New York JFK to Los Angeles This morning's flight was my ninth with JetBlue Service was superb Water bottles plus drink and snack service were given out about half hour after takeoff a couple of trash runs made and if you needed to get anything the little fridge in between Mint and Even More Space with snacks as well as the back galley towels were given out during initial descent I bought a chicken sandwich since I was starving and it wasn't bad I love the fact that I'm Even More Space you get so much room to stretch your legs out The airline offered many free movies on demand as well as directTV Looking forward to my flight back to NYC on Monday", "Orlando to Richmond Stranded at the gate without any notification The JetBlue ap still had the flight listed as On Time but the flight at the gate changed to another destination No notice and no flights out of Orlando to Richmond that day Our business client was left stranded We will never book a flight with JetBlue again If you depend on your airline to deliver on what they sell loof elsewhere Clearly with the long line of passengers waiting to find alternate flights due to the multiple JetBlue canceled flights this is standard practice for JetBlue If the flight isn't full they cancel and cut their losses at the expense of the passengers A simple refund will not make up for our loss of revenue and our disappointed client left stranded in Richmond Stay clear of this airline", "Fort Lauderdale to San Jose Costa Rica Boarding process was very relaxed despite the fact the the flight was full We paid the upgrade to even more space The comfort and space were unparalleled Wifi on board Live TV Staff willing to help Everything was on time Right before taking off we were notified that there was a problem with one of the slides They attempted to repair it while we were on board and were unable to do so They apologized and had to request that we get off the airplane while they tried to work on it The captain remained at the gate updating passengers as he received information They managed to fix everything within 30 minutes All in all we were delayed by 2 hours But we understand that it happens The airline did what it needed to do fix the problem and make sure the passengers were safe informed and reassured The flight was flawless service was great Attendants were professional kind and taking care of passengers In 24 hours I received an email with an airline credit and apologies for the delay On our way back we sat in regular economy seats Leg room was ample Service was amazing Couldn't ask for more", "Boston to New York I am so disappointed by my experience with JetBlue from two weeks ago After sitting on the plane on the runway for an hour we were all told to exit the plane and wait in a very long line to figure out how to fix our travel plans There were about 5 of us traveling to Honolulu who got completely screwed because we missed our connecting flight The only option for us was to wait 12 hours for a flight to Vegas Honolulu then a 3 hour delay before finally flying to Lihue for me This means I missed my first night in my hotel I was 14 hours late to my final destination I missed my shuttle and had to pay for a taxi which was ridiculously expensive When I wrote to JetBlue they refused to reimburse me for anything and gave me a 50 credit You can't fly anywhere for 50 This company is worth hundreds of millions of dollars yet they can't afford to pay for their mistakes", "New York to Las Vegas We were to fly out of New York May 5th but they canceled our flight I understand weather and such but delay it would have been better I called customer service to the tune of I am sorry nothing we can do We had a show that was paid for months ago and important to get to Las Vegas before 8pm They could only get us on a 6 7pm flight which put us into LV after the show had started Considering airlines were flying out in the afternoon when the weather was better JetBlue could not even accommodate by adding a flight that would have helped many of us who had to scramble for another airline Every airline we checked was full or flying out in the evening You could imagine how upset I was JetBlue has a high cancellation record and I have been flying with them since the beginning Dealing with TV's that haven't worked to sometimes unfriendly crew members I brushed it off When customer service on the phone says this has happened to them and they didn't take it out on the person trying to help them after asking them how would they feel if this happen to them That was wrong Flying home on JetBlue was terrible Full flight and the TV's did not work It was a new plane and they did not work Crew was not that friendly empty cups and soda bottles were left under the seats I feel like they have overgrown No regard for the inconvenience of their passengers who have to shell out hundreds more dollars for a flight with another carrier or who miss important events If you cancel a flight figure out rescheduling a little later That is the right thing to do Put another airplane into use with a crew I will tell you we flew out on Delta and I was very impressed I have 2 more trips on JetBlue coming up and then I think I need to part ways I felt at their mercy like they shrugged their shoulders I have choices and they should understand that Sometimes the lower fare is not the best choice I have written them many times on their great service and flights Now I can't say that They price gauge for everything from seating room 70 for more legroom and the seats are not much more comfortable At least on Delta seats are wider and more comfortable for an up charge This put us out almost 500 that we did not expect to spend Everyone has their opinion and experience with each airline JetBlue is getting a thumbs down for the added stress it put on my short weekend in Vegas", "Just flew JetBlue for the first time from Orlando to Los Angeles The plane was dirty the staff were less than attentive They couldn't be bothered to help with service of any kind We were in row 1 so the two times they did come by once for food and once for trash they rushed past our row without stopping to ask if we wanted or needed anything We had to ask them to come back I will avoid flying this airline again", "First time flying with Jetblue from Detroit to Ft Lauderdale and I'm writing this review while I'm in the air because the wifi is free Incredible service from staff and I fly frequently delta spirit etc The captain introduced himself before we flew and made sure to welcome us at the gate I'm in an incredibly nervous flyer and when we hit turbulence the captain made sure not only to switch the seatbelt sign on and he took the time to reassure the passengers He made me feel so much safer The seats had plenty of room and the staff were excellent Definitely will be flying Jetblue again", "New York La Guardia to Fort Lauderdale My husband and I had a layover in Fort Lauderdale which was supposed to be for two hours Instead we were delayed for almost five hours By the time we got to our hotel it was 1am I can honestly say my family and will do all possible to refrain from flying JetBlue in the future We paid for the even more space seats and we were squeezed in them The seat space is just the distance from seat to seat Not the seat itself", "This was the first time I have flown Jetblue flying from Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale but it will not be the last I was impressed from beginning to end The check in staff were helpful and friendly My flight attendants were excellent The departures and arrivals both ways were flawless The on board amenities are bar none In this day an age excellent customer service is hard to find", "Flew home last night flight from Las Vegas to New York JFK flight 1248 Wanted to give credit where credit is due This was the first flight I have flown where the captain came over the PA and made an announcement assuring us about the turbulence how uncomfortable it can be for us but to be reassured the aircraft can handle these type of situations and not to worry I felt he did everything he can possibly do to try and avoid the constant turbulence to make for a peaceful flight Will make sure to make JetBlue as my first flight choice in the future", "The only criteria to book my connecting flight from Boston to JFK on this airline was the very convenient departure time I had not flown on this airline before nor did I have any idea what I was going to expect From entering the Terminal C in Boston until leaving the dedicated Terminal in JFK it was a unique and breathtaking experience When I approached the self check in kiosks at Logan a smartly dressed employee came up to me and assisted me through the entire process The whole check in area had more the appearance of an After work lounge than an airport facility Everything looked so classy like out of some Hollywood movie There were no lines at security and I was through in a breeze Doors were closed on time The seats on the small Embraer jet were comfortable even for me as a tall guy I took advantage of the live television broadcast on the individual screens and caught up with the latest political and weather news There was a 30 minute departure delay out of Boston but we reached the gate at JFK right on time In between the young and enthusiastic crew served softdrinks and snacks of high quality Jet Blue is without any doubt the best American domestic carrier I have ever flown on", "Orlando to New York JFK Very disappointed was 1 minute late to check in at kiosk for a 6am flight and by the time I made it to the crew member it was another 4 mins in the agent would not allow my family of 4 including a lap child to check in saying that I had to have checked in 40 mins prior to flight and adding that the flights are booked due to a delay the evening before and they had to accomodate several other passengers This is ridiculous we had 3 paid seats which they gave away for a minute delay we could have easily made to the gate on time if the agent had shown a little care and checked us in When I called the customer service center to report this issue they were not helpful and said there was nothing they could do I am returning home and waiting to go back to airport for a 6 40 pm flight enough of my issue a word of advice to whoever is flying and running a little bit behind make sure to take a few minutes to do online check in so you can ensure that you are checked in 40 minute prior and then as needed print your tickets at kiosk This really was not nice", "I flew from Salt Lake City to New York with my mother 76 years I fell asleep then my mom woke me up telling me she was not feeling well My mom almost passed out for a short time I called the flight attendant who showed up I told her my mom does not feel well and I asked her for water she grabbed a small bottle of water and disappeared She could not even asked me what was wrong with my mother I have no idea how this woman works as a flight attendant Smile and be nice to people is not hard at all Very disappointed with Jetblue service They did not provide anything not even water Flight 72 Saturday April 22 of 2017", "Charleston to Fort Lauderdale Today I should be on the spring break vacation with the young children and teenage nieces that I have been planning for 6 weeks Due to a cancellation and no rebooking availability on Jetblue I sit at home writing this oh so very true review There are no considerable hotels available within driving distance Thus there is very little we can do at this point to overcome the disappoint our family is encountering After two hours and getting no where with Jetblue I am simultaneously attempting to cancel all other accommodations arranged for this trip I am highly discouraged by this airline's lack of treatment to its patrons Customer service under provided when it could have chosen to be highlighted as unforgettably amazing Jetblue better step up its CS game or face serious future consequences Empower your employees to do want is right in extenuating circumstances We are people not systems Southwest here we come again gave JB straight one star because I wouldn't know never boarded the flight and couldn't be rebooked for another As it related to value for money the minimal credit issued does not come close to covering our losses My kids are heartbroken", "New York JFK to Los Angeles Whereas I've often seen that when a couple of family comes aboard separated they will sit together and when someone comes who has the seat they all work it out with my volume of travel and my teams' we're often those people who switch our seat here's how JetBlue made this mess There were no adjacent tickets available for purchase when we bought the tix so we ended up with two mint window seats and two aisle seats each set on opposite sides of the aisle my 11 year old son sat on his own but of course we couldn't leave my 7 year old little girl sitting alone by a window seat while my wife sat on the other side of the aisle without even full view of my daughter and have some stranger sit next to my little girl So my wife sat next to my little girl until we could talk to the person in that seat who we assumed would be reasonable like the rest of us Then one of the gate staff came in and told my wife she had to move leave my 7 year old little girl who still carries her pink blanket with her alone I went up and told them there was no way we were leaving our little girl alone in that seat wait for some stranger to sit there and hope the airline could work it out The guy across the aisle was sweet amidst what was becoming a tense situation and offered to trade which was great I then went up to tell the pilot stewardess and offending gate person that I was going to issue a formal complaint and rather than simply apologizing or even just saying something like I understand of course go ahead he threatened to have our family wait for the next flight if I complained I was speechless and since my wife and my daughter were now sitting together safely I let it go Do they train these airline people on customer service and service recovery at all Do you JetBlue", "Due to fly Jetblue from JFK to Charleston Entire weekend cancelled trip cancelled completely with no options and all they say is sorry we can provide you a refund Seriously You have got to be kidding I took off two days off

provide no solution for Thursday they re book me out of Philadelphia for the following day Friday with a layover On Friday they delay my flight so I would miss the layover After hours on the phone without any solutions they give me a refund Sorry a refund does not cover the days I took off from work and the vacation that was completely ruined and the wedding that I missed", "Austin to New York JFK This is my 8th flight on jetBlue and service has always been impeccable Crew are pretty friendly On this flight there were two movies available for free Wi Fi drinks and snacks were complimentary too and served about 45 mins after takeoff for our 3 5 hour flight back to New York I flew with my partner as usual on a buddy pass and this time we were given one row each on Even More Space but opted to sit together flight was almost full The best thing about flying on the Embraer 190 is that it's one row of 2 seats on each side of the aircraft so if you're a couple like us there's no one sitting on either side Thanks again for great service", "Rochester to Albuquerque My father flew alone with the assistance of the wonderful crew of Jet Blue My father has Vascular Dementia and with

made to make him comfortable with his medical condition", "West Palm Beach to New York JFK with Jetblue Airways Brand new plane very nice entertainment wifi is excellent I can chat with my friends while in the air But my concern was the food which was not that great Staff are excellent and friendly but they need to offer good snacks The interior of the plane is clean", "Flew from Orlando to New York JFK with Jetblue Airways A brand new A321 was awaiting me at the gate Aircraft was in great shape and the interiors were excellent Professional service at MCO with a smooth and on time check in A great variety of snacks and drinks are complimentary which is something not seen in other domestic US carriers Another aspect of JetBlue which made the journey comfortable was the complimentary Wi Fi Great service onboard and the journey seemed shorter than it usually feels due to the great facilities onboard JetBlue is surely my choice of travel for all domestic journeys in the USA due to its modern fleet and great service", "Los Angeles to New York JFK Travel with a service animal Have animal training certificate and proper identification My pet is a seizure alert medical service animal

and not for families If you are a single person with no luggage then it's a great airline If you have a family then it's abysmal I wasn't even able to sit next to my wife and children even after a service representative assured me that we would be next to each other Cost us an extra five hundred dollars in fees to fly", "West Palm Beach to Westchester I love Jetblue however staff never follow their own rules regarding carry on baggage 2 bags a carry on and 1 personal item One bag in the overhead space If they actually enforced this there would be room for everyone I sit and watch people get on the plane with 3 sometimes 4 bags and I watch them put everything in the overhead bins Then people that pay just as much as everyone else but board later have to check their bags This is so frustrating Enforce the rules Jetblue it's not that difficult", "I have flown Jetblue for years and loved them However the last year has been a disaster for them Flight delays and cancellations have become the rule rather than the exception I don't usually write reviews but this particular time I was suppose to fly from Burlington to Washington Dulles which is considered a short flight My flight was to leave Burlington at 5 40 with a layover in New York and get to Virginia at 9am It is now projected that I will arrive in Virginia at 12 1am An almost 24 hour delay I am sorry for the employees

where you are going on time pick another airline", "Chicago to New York JFK I first flew Jetblue in 2008 09 I was sceptical then to give a review as I thought let me give it some time see if they are consistent I love JetBlue because they are punctual and the seats are the most comfortable of any airline I've flown there is heaps of leg room in economy class There is a screen in the back of the seat directly in front of me and I can watch whatever I choose to In all a very comfortable pleasant airline to fly with I choose Jetblue over all others Thank you for your service", "Phoenix to Boston JetBlue Airways attracts it's customers with low prices for airfare as well as complimentary items such as their free 36 Direct TV channels on their in flight entertainment systems However while complimentary items and low airfare are nice the customer service always needs to be a priority and that is what was lacking on Flight 602 service to Boston Even though this was a Red eye flight aka an all nighter I believe that at the least flight attendants shouldn't be screaming for people to sit down The attendants on this flight I can imagine probably don't like their shift but taking it out on the passengers isn't right And while I understand that they have a tight schedule to keep they are perfectly capable of saying please and thank you every once in a while All I have to say is that if you think low airfare and complimentary items beats Customer Service in the airline industry then Jetblue Airways isn't so bad but personally I prefer an airline with good customer service", "San Juan to New York JFK This is has been my fourth flight with JetBlue using a buddy pass with my partner and service has been awesome Flight time was slightly under four hours back to JFK Checkin at San Juan was a breeze since we had nothing but backpacks so we just printed the tickets on a machine and after arriving at the gate were informed our flight was gonna be delayed which wasn't a big deal Afterwards we were called and assigned seats on Even More Space right behind L2 Flight attendants were extremely courteous and offered me a free snack box which was absolutely delicious Afterwards drinks and snacks were served and we had a pretty smooth ride back home I love the fact that each time I have flown with JetBlue everyone seems so upbeat from the ground crew to the flight crew Looking forward to our next flight in a month or so", "Hartford to Orlando I recently flew this 2 hour 30 minute flight with a friend Shortly after take off I noticed my TV was not working I quickly notified a flight attendant who was very nice and accommodating and offering to switch my seat or offer me a credit towards next flight Flying with a friend I opted out of changing my seat Everyone was very nice and I love flying with Jetblue as I do often However I was a little disappointed that I could not just sit back watch a movie and enjoy the flight", "This is a review of the airline not the flight as I was not allowed to fly I had an 8am flight from Boston to San Francisco in their version of Business Class Mint When I tried to checking online it would not allow me so I went to the airport and at the kiosk I was also told to see someone I stood in line for 30 minutes and was refused a ticket despite having paid for the ticket in advanced on my frequent flyer account on JetBlue site I had a charge from JetBlue on a previous family trip that I was disputing with my credit card company as fraudulent Although I had not received notice it appears the credit card company agreed the charges were fraudulent and reversed the charges Despite selling me a ticket they would not let me get a boarding ticket without paying the fraudulent charges that were in dispute The shift supervisor said that I could not do anything but pay and that there was no one else to talk to about it In short I missed my flight and had to rebook on a real carrier later and missed important meeting Very unprofessional and despicable that they would book a ticket and not honor the transaction with no notice", "Chicago to Nassau via Boston Ft Lauderdale with Jetblue Airways Both

whole experience I'm on the flight now and felt compelled to write since I was so satisfied It seems JetBlue thinks about all their processes and ways to be most efficient and customer service oriented For example they take your drink order and bring the drinks instead of blocking the whole aisle with a drink cart Smart", "Fort Lauderdale to New Orleans with Jetblue The attendants are always helpful at the front kiosks Very attentive and helping quickly At the terminal they have tables with plenty of outlets and charging stations for phones On board the flight attendants are nice but the selection of food drinks is limited The onboard wifi only works when flying near or over land so that didn't work 100 of the flight but the TV worked the entire flight Checked baggage reached the carousel quickly Overall Jetblue delivers everything you need with some added luxuries", "Ft Lauderdale to New Orleans Will never fly JetBlue again Had to fly out quickly to see my ailing father Paid for a bag each way in advance Then a few days after making reservations I called to see if I could get my bag credit each way as I could forego the checked bag JetBlue Customer service refused to credit my 50 bag each way Hope the 100 was worth losing another JetBlue Customer Way too much competition out there Will never fly them again", "New York JFK to Santiago Cibao After delaying the flight for 3 5 hours and switching everyone from one plane to the other 3 times they decided to cancel the flight All the help we got from the people there was to let us know that the way to proceed was calling the 1 800 jet blue so they can try to put us on other flights We spent more than 12 hours until we were able to get on a plane", "Reno to Burlington via New York JFK Jetblue is an unbelievably poor airline Was excited about their new Reno to jfk flight but after this trip I'll do everything I can to avoid them again Their mobile boarding pass didn't register my seat number and the gate agent got involved and ended up pulling me off the plane because he couldn't find me on the roster Turns out he was searching for me by first name instead of last So I missed the flight and spent the day in JFK airport And top it off they did nothing for a refund no food voucher not even an apology Pathetic customer service", "Orlando to Boston with JetBlue Our flight was extremely pleasant Our flight attendant was amazing and made sure we comfortable our entire flight I have flown with JetBlue several times and I have always had a great experience Highly recommend others", "Utterly useless Flight from Reno to Long Beach was 2 hours late checked the city it departed from and there were no weather or other extreme delays on that end so what gives Also had to go back to the ticket counter twice because the boarding passes they printed the first time wouldn't scan at security Friendly enough employees but they will nickel and dime you for everything be prepared before you get on the plane I really would of preferred to pay a few more dollars and book with an airline that wouldn't make me multiple hours late for work for no reason but I didn't book this trip", "Jetblue is a great example of cheap and cheerful OK it was really a short round trip between Boston and New York 40 to 45 minutes each way but from experience this does not mean unpleasant surprises can't happen The flight out was a new route to LaGuardia so the passengers even got a free morning snack bagel with some jam Unlike most airlines Jetblue did not threaten people forcing them to surrender their cabin baggage but instead asked for a specific number of volunteers Our flight back was at 11pm but we arrived earlier and it turns out that Jetblue can try to put you on an earlier flight for free if it's just one flight earlier They managed to fit us on a flight one hour earlier Both flights were on time despite going between very busy airports and since the allotted time takes into consideration possible delays we arrived earlier than scheduled in both times The best part is how organized Jetblue flights are From a boarding procedure that like in APAC fills the back rows first so that long queues don't get stuck behind to the way they distribute drinks ask first then only bring what's needed instead of pushing the trolley for half an hour", "Flew from San Jose Costa Rica to Orlando Jetblue's A320 has the most comfortable seating in economy that I have been in and at 6' 4 and 300 pounds that is a very positive thing Unfortunately that is about the only positive Fares were reasonable but the absurd 55 for two bags and 20 for one is a pure ripoff They provided nothing except soft drinks juice on the flight the snacks were tiny and even the overpriced food they were pushing looked like something out of a nightmare It seems to me that with fuel prices half what they were a couple of years ago completely booked flights and charging for every amenity they could be a bit more generous In contrast an Avianca flight from Panama City Panama to San Jose earlier in the day had a perfectly acceptable breakfast snack with quality products and no baggage fees Outdone by a Colombian airline", "Fort Lauderdale to Cleveland One of my group didn't have a seat assignment on their ticket We went up to the check in desk to address this issue Once there a gentleman on the same flight was waiting for assistance but there was no one at the desk However there was an employee standing at the front of the entry line deep in conversation with a woman in a wheelchair We waited patiently for someone to come and take care of the man in front of us as well as ourselves Five minutes passed with no one attending the desk One of the pilots came over so he could board the plane He received no assistance After waiting a few minutes He walked up to the agent and proceeded to ask why he wasn't helping the man who was still waiting at the desk The pilot walked away looking frustrated The agent proceeded to turn back to his conversation leaving the customer still waiting at the desk Eventually the agent started to walk away from the woman he'd been talking to when the husband stepped up and entered the conversation At that point I walked up to him excused myself and ask if there was anyone working the desk He said yes and I proceeded to ask when they would be coming He hesitated for a moment before identifying himself as said attendant He finally asked what my needs were The man at the attendant station still stood unhelped with a look of aggregation on his face The agent asked us to wait saying he'd be right back as he walked to the desk We followed behind him just in case he got distracted again The first customer's frustration grew based on his look of discuss at having been completely overlooked Fortunately a second agent showed up to the desk and helped the first guy I've never seen such poor customer service at an airport in my life If this is the way JetBlue treats it's customers they just lost my business", "New York JFK to Ft Lauderdale I purchased a non refundable ticket in advance and selected a seat 3c at time of purchase When checking in and obtaining my boarding pass they changed my reserved seat to 32c in back of the plane They had no right to give away my seat as I purchased a nonrefundable ticket If I wanted to change or cancel my reservation they would hit me up with the full fare and if I changed the time or date they would have charged more There policy is wrong and unfair I should have been given the seat I originally reserved I have choices in the future and will choose an airline a bit more honest than jetblue", "Syracuse to Fort Lauderdale All around great experience with Jetblue Airways At the airport the ground crew were excellent Booked a 'Need more Space' seat It was comfortable and spacious row 1 Flight crew was amazing and the luggage came off quickly Plane was not new but relatively clean All TVs functioned well Free 'Flyfi' was a great bonus My only complaint might be that the tray table which came up out of the arm and was hinged in the middle was bent so it was difficult to put a beverage on and remain confident that it would not end up in my lap All in all two thumbs up", "Boston to Las Vegas with Jetblue It had been sometime since I'd taken a US domestic flight so was unsure what to expect at check in However it was easy and quick which made the early morning flight a breeze Boarding row by row however became a little complicated as the announcer didn't speak clearly It was a 5 hour flight and although you have to pay for refreshments no cash accepted they provided 2 complimentary soft and hot drinks and snack service Arrived early into LAS and baggage collection was prompt Will use again", "New York JFK to Orlando with Jetblue Ever since I moved to Florida I have been taking a lot of trips back and forth to New York I am always shopping around to save I have tried other airlines and in the end Jetblue always turns out to be a better experience The planes are roomy there is a TV for everyone and you end up saving more than with other airlines Other airlines try to get you with a cheaper ticket and then over charge you for carry on With Jetblue your carry on is free and checked baggage fees are not too high They always offer you a drink and a snack for your trip I love to fly Jetblue", "Newark to Boston Being a first time flyer on jetBlue the trip was excellent Amazing service from crew very polite and welcoming They walk you through each step from check in and to boarding My flight only lasted around fifty minutes and the seat and entertainment system kept me happy There are over 75 different live TV channels to choose from As a bonus that comes with the system is a flight map and Sirus XM radio I will definitely recommend jetBlue to anyone", "For the past several flights that I have take with JetBlue their online departures have been horrific It honestly does not have to do with the weather We are sitting in New Orleans airport staring at a weather radar map that is clear for the US Our flight to New York JFK is delayed for two hours It is the only flight on the board that is delayed That's it JetBlue you are not worth my money or time anymore your service is pathetic", "I flew jet blue to Orlando in July The return segment was delayed for 3 hrs Today September 4th I was traveling as a standby passenger and got booted off after boarding the plane Due to weight restrictions and excess luggage issues Another passenger volunteered to exit the plane so that I could make the flight He did in fact deplane along with his wife and daughter I was still asked to leave because of luggage problems I then waited 2 hours for it to be returned to me Then I was told that one piece of luggage was left back on the plane So I was asked to deplane because of weight and luggage issues yet my suitcase left without me Bravo jetblue You have officially lost a customer", "You get what you pay for with Jetblue Simple formula that works very well Flew from Orlando to Salt Lake City Perhaps the age of the plane varies thus the seat designs change but overall it's a predictable formula which I very much appreciate in the US This was a 4 5 hour flight so quite long We paid for extra legroom which to me makes all the difference Was worth it I didn't eat throughout the flight but got plenty of water and was on the wifi the whole time which worked very well For short haul flights JetBlue is the way to go", "I have always been a avid JetBlue customer I have even highly recommended them to family and friends But in the last month I have had nothing but delayed and canceled flights I'm not sure if it is a management problem but they seem to never be able to keep their schedule I have flown three times in the last month and all three time I have had over two hour delays 7 13 8 5 and now again 8 18 To make it worse they never have a reason Once I was told it was because of bad weather in Orlando where the plane was coming from but when I checked the weather in Orlando it was perfect with 10 chance of rain My flight is a 25 minute flight from San Juan to St Croix and it seems to always be delayed for hours That just doesn't make sense I'm waiting 8 times longer than my flight time It is unacceptable that a company can charge hundreds of dollars for ticket with no responsibility I recommend not to use JetBlue unless you have to today I know there are not many better choices", "My sister and her husband were headed on their honeymoon to the Bahamas Everything was paid for ahead of time and all set to go They left Ohio went to Detroit to get a flight to Fort Lauderdale and from there Jetblue Airways was taking them to the Bahamas Come to find out once they landed in Fort Lauderdale their flight with Jetblue canceled 2 days ago They were not notified in anyway They went through hoops trying to catch a flight still today and found one but it has a 5 hour layover They are missing out on an entire day of their planned and paid for activities due to this inconvenience and incompetence No customer representative was willing to help them or try to compensate for their loss", "The ticket agent neglected to inform me that the seat assignment in an extra space row had nowhere to put your feet because the seat was directly behind the flight attendant's jump seat which was attached to a wall I could not put my feet under the flight attendant's jump seat because of the wall Having two tears in my right meniscus I cannot keep my knees bent at a 90 angle for several hours but that is precisely what I was forced to do on Jetblue from JFK to LAX on 9 August 2016 I ended up standing for nearly 3 hours of the 5 5 hr flight It was a full plane and no other seats were available My knee swelled up and I spent the last hour and a half of the flight icing it The ticket agent also prepared two boarding passes with my name on them giving one to me and the other to my travel friend which prevented my friends from getting through security and requiring them to go back to the ticket counter for a new boarding pass Jetblue's response There's nothing we can get do because have already flown", "Normally flying out of Boston Logan we fly JetBlue a lot The service is great and food is good for a short flight Flight entertainment is excellent with Direct TV and SiriusXM Flight has aways been on time Very quick check in Seats are excellent for short flights and extra legroom is worth it They also have a lot of international partners so it is easy for connections especially at Boston Logan since Terminal C is only a few minuets from Terminal E", "Denver to Boston with Jetblue This flight was delayed over 3 hours and this was not communicated in time for passengers to adjust travel plans and even if we could have a second email encouraged us to arrive on time because Jetblue was trying to reduce the delay When we got to the gate it was clear that there was no chance the delay could be reduced This was not transparent to any of the people on this flight and incredibly disappointing customer service The staff while very kind was clearly not allowed to communicate any useful information to passengers", "I went on a trip to NYC and on the return flight JFK to Jacksonville we show up early for a 9pm flight After being their two hours the plane became delayed until 1am as it got later and later the flight kept being pushed back further and further after sitting at the airport for 10 hours they finally tell us that the plane has arrived and they need to clear etc no sooner did they tell us that they have decided to cancel the flight We were given no other information The jetblue staff refused to help anyone They made us go back to the check in desk to get on another flight So after making us sit 10 hrs for a cancelled flight we were expected to stand in line for another few hours to get a flight I walked to the front of the line and demanded help The first lady rude and dismissive finally I walked over to another lady and I just lost it and had a full on panic attack in front if the whole airport Finally she got me tickets There was not a flight until two days later I was refused any kind of hotel accommodation because it was due to weather We had to spend money on taxi services to go back and forth from a relative's apartment that we were staying with If I hadn't had a relative in the city their only other suggestion would be to sleep on a cot for the next two days in the airport We were never offered any kind of food or drink voucher It was the most awful experience I have ever had in an airport with an airline I would never fly JetBlue again", "I just want to give a shout out for the excellent service I received from Jetblue staff I loved flying with your company We flew to the Dominican Republic to do some humanitarian work and we traveled with a lot of equipment Jetblue staff notified us that there was no charge for the luggage carrying dental supplies for our trip This was wonderful I was very impressed with everything about Jetblue This was my first time flying JetBlue and I traveled with my immediate family members plus one niece and one set of grandparents Our group was eight in total We loved the snacks the fact that we got our own television for each person and the extra leg room One of our flights left in the middle of the night and the snooze pack was the best I would love to see flights out of Boise Idaho", "Ft Lauderdale to Detroit with Jetblue I chose this airlines because I figured that anything would be better than Spirit but how wrong I was The flight to Florida went off without a hitch however the flight home was a different story The flight was delayed by more than 2 45 minutes and of course we were not extended the courtesy of being informed of this as we were checking in baggage It was only realized as we approached the gate where we encountered hundreds of angry passengers There was zero communication We were told to stand in the line containing hundreds of people if we wanted to make other arrangements Needless to say after standing there for over an hour only to watch the line shorten by 1 person I had had enough I called the 800 number where I was informed they could book me on the next days flight but they couldn't tell me where how or what to do about my luggage Had they told me upon the time I was checking in my luggage I could have made the decision as to what to do at that moment but to mislead me take my money and send me upstairs to what they knew was a nightmare was far more unprofessional It only took a little communication and a bit of honesty and you wouldn't have lost my future business", "I was traveling with familly to Long Beach from Boston When I bought the tickets online I wasn't able to choose the seats When I called the airline they told me that we would get our seats when ticketing Our seats ended up scattered I complained and later I was able get my kids to sit together During the flight when I asked for a drink for the second time the flight attendant refused saying that drink service time was over so I should go to the back and get it myself Finally we checked in two bags at the same time One bag arrived but the other one didn't From the start to the end we had a very unpleasant flying experience and will not be using Jetblue Airways again", "New York JFK to Punta Cana with Jetblue My midnight flight has been delayed 4 times after I arrived at the airport and has now been cancelled The next flight is 2 days later which is too late I waited in line for Jetblue customer service for 1 hour for them to close and re open in 1 hour e g 3 00am When I spoke to customer service on the phone she didn't know what airports are in Dominican Republic so she wasn't sure which ones Jet Blue flies into Her recommendation was that I cancel my flight or check online for the next availability The car rental I booked through Jetblue is now my problem and I have to call them directly to cancel and deal with any incurred cost Worst customer service I have experienced in years I still have no idea why my flight was cancelled", "I have previously written a less than kind review about Spirit Airlines Because of a previous unpleasant trip with Spirit I decided to try Jetblue Airways on a recent trip I can not say enough good things about the company and its employees First I had to cancel an earlier flight with them due to a sudden illness of my wife They were very accommodating and gave me a credit that was good for a year I finally was able to take that trip in the last couple of weeks We flew roundtrip from Detroit to Fort Lauderdale Both directions were absolutely on time The seats were comfortable and the crew was fantastic Thanks Jetblue for a great trip", "Literally on the Jetblue flight from Boston to Seattle right now Disgruntled looking flight attendant first thought is he's tired So I am sitting next to a girl who doesn't speak much English and is understandably hungry I show her how to call the attendant with the button and patiently help her request water and snack from said attendant He says dryly there's a menu due to the fact I can't recall the name of the item she wants Then I ask for coffee to which he stares at me blankly and walks away He brings my coffee and I say thank you loudly He says nothing so I say thank you once more as he hands me my ice no response My husband who was sleeping even heard me thank him Very rude person Has nothing to do with the airline but he needs to brush up on his customer service Will repost if I catch his name", "Washington DC to Nassau via Fort Lauderdale has been by far the worst experience we have had with any airline service The way JetBlue does business is absurd Our flight left from DC to Fort Lauderdale where we had a one hour layover before connecting to Nassau Bahamas final destination During the one hour layover the boarding gate changed three times from E8 to E6 to E10 After changing gates multiple times we find out that the flight actually departed from E8 and we missed our flight They did not call our names over loudspeaker because they didn't even know our names or know that we were missing from the flight The next flight wasn't until later in the evening therefore missed a whole day of our vacation To compensate us JetBlue gave us a 40 voucher each towards our next flight Needless to say we won't be flying JetBlue again", "Flew San Francisco to New York JFK Jetblue mint class surpasses any international business class I have flown Amazing comfort great entertainment

there til 7 45am Plenty of the other people missed there next flight in Boston due to the lack of urgency", "The JetBlue Airport staff after security were the worst I have experienced in all my years of travel After security we went to our original gate where we realized it was changed to 11 When we arrived at our new gate boarding already began As we were walking in my wife made a humorous comment about the gate change It was then that one of the JetBlue staff members rudely interrupted our conversation to chime in you know gates do change and you are responsible to know about these changes Upon boarding we were shocked to see that our overhead storage compartment was completely taken We had paid extra money to receive the extra legroom seats and we were seated in row 1 It appeared that all of the passengers seated behind us had placed their luggage in the first 6 rows of overhead compartments I decided to take a seat and wait for everyone to be seated so I could walk to the back of the plane to place my bags this seemed like the only option being that my wife and I had two carry on bags with absolutely no free compartments in sight It was here where one of the flight attendants came up to me and said sir you cannot have your bags in front of you I kindly told her that there was no space in any compartments near me she said you need to go to the back of the plane and find space Have paid extra for the even more space seat and paying to sit in row 1 I was flabbergasted when we asked the flight attendant for a blanket for my pregnant wife and she responded with that's 5 dollars how will you pay It was about 30 minutes into the flight when the flight attendant came through with water and asked what drinks we would like I requested for a Ginger ale and the flight attendant wrote it down It was 42 minutes to be exact before I received my wife's drink I asked the flight attendant twice about the drink Being that our seats were 1C and 1D it was literally two steps away from where they store the drinks They were purposely avoiding getting this drink Please save yourself money and fly with another airline", "New York JFK to Orlando This was my first time traveling with JetBlue The service was excellent and the staff was very professional They were very polite and kind My only concern was the TSA staff in JetBlue premises who were rude and sarcastic to my family which made them very upset It was a very unpleasant experience to start our vacation", "Fort Lauderdale to Nassau with Jetblue JetBlue never fail to disappoint with their amazing service on the ground and in the air especially with all of their inflight amenities such as TV's at every seat and free snacks and drinks Being such as quick flight they offered their express service which consisted of a bottled water and choice of cookies blue chips or pretzels Since JetBlue isn't that expensive I would opt out to fly them at anytime My only hope would be that they connect between more places on the west coast but understandable since they are an east coast airline Other than that JetBlue tops my list", "Orlando to San Juan with Jetblue I was pleasantly surprised with the value Low price free snacks and drinks WiFi free Premium movies Direct Tv Sirius radio spacious and comfortable seats staff was friendly I loved it Will definitely fly with Jetblue again", "I was traveling from New York to Bridgetown Barbados and I enjoyed my four hour flight on JetBlue Airways My only complaint was I just wish there was more legroom as a tall person it was a little tight and having my legs go numb wasn't so great The flight attendants were extremely friendly mixed with a little humor and there were unlimited snacks I would definitely fly with JetBlue again", "Los Angeles to New York JFK More legroom and free Wi Fi plus power outlets for every seat JetBlue's standard legroom is what you get if you upgrade to premium economy on other airlines Virgin America is close but tends to be more expensive Each seat has excellent on screen entertainment The food choices are good and reasonable with unlimited free brand name snacks And they fly nonstop from BUR to JFK", "New York to Santo Domingo with Jetblue Very unprofessional staff Check in was a nightmare First they tried to charge me 20 for each bag we were checking in on the international When they realized they made a mistake they told me that my carry on bag was too big so they could charge me 35 for it Have to make money somehow Flight was not any better experience They told me that I cannot put my back pack into the luggage storage area because it was only for passengers with bigger carry on bags even though that was the only carry on bag we had Moreover there was no selection of drinks or any food", "Jacksonville to New York JFK return with Jetblue Our recent trip felt like a third tier super economy experience rather than the good value plus human touch approach they used to stand for Both flights of our round trip were delayed by hours and although they provided some snacks and vouchers outbound Jacksonville the return experience at JFK was abysmal We wandered to a counter which was closed despite the open sign and were actually berated by the agent who offered no help guiding us to the open desks Unbelievable And when we finally checked in the staff made no eye contact no thank you no you're welcome the experience couldn't have been colder Same on our flight where you now have to fork over five bucks for every blanket pillow bag of pretzels or earphones to a robotic flight attendant who clearly just wants to get home like the rest of us So much for the human airline", "JetBlue does not know what customer service means and this was my first and last flight on this airline On this flight I was checking in my luggage and I waited for 10 minutes at the drop your bag line I had already checked in online but I did not have a printed boarding pass When I arrived at the counter a rude attendant supervisor told me I was in the wrong line He rudely told me that I had to go the end of the main check in line even though I had already checked in online I explained to him that I had already waited 10 minutes and pleaded to accommodate me at the drop your bag line but he told me it didn't matter and he directed me to go the end of the main line I refused to go and I asked to speak to the manager The manager arrived and also rudely told me to do the same thing to go to the end of the main line I travel on business regularly and have not been treated by such rude attendants as JetBlue I was concerned I would miss my flight but the attendants just flippantly said that if I miss the flight I would have to get on a later flight Fortunately I purchased the TSA pre check which expedited my pass through the security gate I'm very disappointed with this experience and will never fly JetBlue ever again", "surprised with the legroom space that was awesome Flight crew were nice helpful and polite Snacks were okay nothing special I have to mention cheap fares and really nice service I was happy with trip", "Washington Dulles to New York JFK with Jetblue This was probably one of the worst experiences I had in over 20 years of regular flying From the beginning till the very end We experienced a delay due to weather conditions However the ground staff was not helpful at all A lot of us had connecting flights and we asked that they contact the airlines we were flying with to check the status They refused We asked that they give us the telephone numbers of the airline so that we the passengers can contact them They refused And as the wifi was not working in the terminal it was difficult to get the numbers We got it despite the refusal of the JetBlue staff We asked to be rerouted to other airlines who were taking off They refused We had over 6 hours delay and as they refused to contact the connecting international airlines we missed 9 of us the connection by few minutes And then the real nightmare started In JFK they were incapable of locating our luggage It took them hours to tell us that finally they can't locate it and we need to come back the next day As there were no seats available on my connecting flight for few days I needed to get my luggage And when we were trying to rebook the people standing at the counters would not take us as 'they had to be free for first class passengers in case they came so they could not serve us' For a low cost airline this sounds like a joke The result was a long queue before one of the counter and at the other the woman starring and not accepting any passenger After 6 30 hours delay and additional 3 hours of trying to figure out what to do this was a particularly bad experience The next day they were incapable of saying where the luggage is I lost the whole day until I finally got my luggage I heard all type of excuses as my luggage was initially checked through to the final destination it was difficult to locate it do they know how t use bar codes or it was not clear where the luggage was etc I finally got my luggage thanks to the assistance from the other airline who tried to help as JetBlue was incapable But they clearly said that this was a JetBlue problem I also asked JetBlue to give me a confirmation about the delay so that my insurance can assist me They refused They said that my insurance from Europe had to call the 0800 number to get a confirmation But they are not providing a confirmation I spoke to not less than 4 different people including the one claiming to be the supervisor they refused Throughout the whole nightmare the one thing that they kept saying consistently was 'I cannot' 'I don't know' 'It is not JetBlue's problem' 'it is not possible' There was no customer service no desire to help no desire to find a solution whatsoever from pretty much everybody working at this company The result of all this is I will never ever fly with JetBlue They are the worst airline I've used and the one flight with them will be the very last", "Las Vegas to Boston with Jetblue Broken seat back cushion hard as a rock I couldn't be more uncomfortable Stewardess seems to find my discomfort amusing Two hour delay taking off because JetBlue doesn't know how to allot for luggage weight I will never voluntarily fly them again no matter how much more I have to pay to avoid them", "On the evening of April 3 I received a notification from JetBlue that the next day's 8 40am flight out of Boston's Logan Airport had been canceled 12 hours in advance This was perplexing as I happened to be leaving Boston at the same time as friends flying different airlines none of their flights were canceled When I called customer service I was told that the cancellation was due to weather and that 'all the other airlines would be canceling their flights in the morning' as well I was initially told that my only option was to take the next JetBlue flight out of Boston at approx 1 30pm I was then told that flight was full my remaining option was to take a Wednesday flight staying two additional nights in Boston at my own expense I asked to be rebooked on another airline and was told I would have to rebook it myself I was offered a refund which the representative later clarified would be only a half refund I rebooked with American for a flight leaving at 8 00am a mere 40 minutes ahead of my original JetBlue flight Surprise surprise it left perfectly on time Unfortunately my new one way ticket cost more than my original roundtrip with JetBlue In situations such as this JetBlue is unable to provide a comparable level of service as other airlines They have a practice of preemptively canceling flights especially those flights which are not full in an effort to control potential delays in other parts of the country If I hadn't had access to internet in order to rebook immediately I would likely still be in Boston It I hadn't had the available funds to rebook at my own expense I would still be in Boston without any place to stay I must add however that since returning home Jetblue has offered to reimburse me for the entirety of the rebooked ticket", "West Palm Beach to Newark When I realized that I left my laptop on the plane I was already shopping for a new one Low and behold it was delivered to lost and found in baggage claim God bless the person cleaning the plane that returned it Other reasons I will always fly JetBlue they are friendly at the airport and on the plane Free wifi and they even make sure that you are able to access so nice to the kids Free drinks and snacks and if your kid needs two bags of chips no problem Upgrades when they can I had told the woman at the ticket counter that me and my kids were in the last row going to Florida She took my tickets and told me to check back in an hour with her When I came back she remembered my name and had already printed the new tickets for Seat 1A 1B and 1C Need I say more Jetblue is all about customer service", "New York JFK to Seattle and how the mighty have fallen JetBlue used to me my airline of choice The planes were clean the service was great the food snacks were good On transcontinental flights there was a good film selection There was an air of humor and intelligence to the way the material for passengers was written The plane I and my husband just flew on was dingy The staff was trying hard but they seemed to be struggling with their own problems The food was terrible no complimentary food for premium economy And the film selection was dreadful Really the tedium of a long flight demands distraction What a miserable experience We will not use JetBlue again unless there is absolutely no other option and the trip is necessary", "JetBlue Airways is the worst company in the airline industry My flight to Long Beach was cancelled early this morning no explanation given My option for a replacement flight is in 2 days a 3 00am flight into a different

to Long Beach if they could comp or reduce my original return flight home in order to help cover the costs of a rental car and drop fee I'd have to pay not to mention we would lose a day of our our vacation by driving No dice They offered no solutions to essentially killing my family's vacation They were unreasonable in helping me to rectify the problem and unsympathetic to non refundable hotel costs their screw up has cost me I have never experienced worse customer service than I did today from JetBlue I will never book a flight with them again I am beyond disappointed and aggravated with such unprofessional and ineffective customer service I will never fly JetBlue again and regret booking my vacation flights with them", "I recently flew standby on JetBlue from Fort Myers Florida to Boston then from Boston to Chicago I was originally going to fly to New York and then to Chicago but when I arrived at the airport my chances of making it to New York on standby were slim Jetblue realised this problem and put me on the earlier flight to Boston instead which had more seats The flight to Chicago from Boston was 30 minutes after we arrived so they placed me in the first row so I would not have any troubles or delays getting off the plane to make it to my next flight The Jetblue staff was extremely understanding compassionate and an overall great employee Thank you JetBlue for your excellent customer service and always going the extra mile", "It was a short flight from Greater Rochester to New York JFK only an hour due to depart at 5 45 a m lifted off at 6 Flight attendants were great and the pilot copilot did a great job also I appreciated their decision to deice just before takeoff It was raining but had been a wintry mix overnight and it probably would have been fine without the deicing but it just made me feel better Good job JetBlue you are my go to airline", "For a five hour flight from New York JFK to San Francisco you'd imagine JetBlue would stock up on food supplies But no When our family of five tried to order something to eat we were told it was all gone Over three hours to go and no food for our kids And the flight attendant's solution was that he actually said we should've brought our own food with us Hello when did airlines give up on service Obviously JetBlue cannot cater to families", "Flew Jetblue from Des Moines to Chicago O'Hare We were on time but due to the size of the aircraft and how small it was for an hour long flight the queuing took a great deal of time and also due to the size I could not see the safety demonstration Seats were far more cramped than other aircrafts I do not believe there was any inflight entertainment or wifi included", "I flew with JetBlue from Boston to Detroit last week as a connecting flight from Dublin Ireland The aircraft was larger than the usual E190 flown to Detroit which was a bonus on this occasion The staff were friendly and full of energy on the ground and in the aircraft They also gave me a more room seat which usually costs extra for free which was great The snacks and drinks were free too The seats were comfortable wifi is free and worked perfectly and there is also free TV I have flown with JetBlue before and they have always been great to fly with", "I often fly JetBlue airways Having switched from American Airlines to JetBlue has been a great experience Considering it is more so a budget type of airline the service is quite on par to their prices The customer service is courteous and friendly The airline has started to outfit their planes with new seats and better inflight entertainment screens The food service amounts to chips and cookies but again it's a budget airline so they serve food accordingly Recently they have started to charge for baggage but if you book online they do offer a better rate than most other airlines that charge Furthermore you can see some of the improvements as previously mentioned newer seats and better inflight entertainment screens Overall JetBlue has provided great service and the customer service reps and cabin crew tend to be quite friendly and courteous", "This is my first time flying JetBlue round trip and I am pleasantly surprised It's easy to see the difference between this and other domestic airlines The additional space in regular economy made more than a difference than I thought The flight crew was courteous and helpful and complimentary snack selection is better than other domestic airlines I liked that the flight attendants didn't walk up down the aisle with carts it allows them to get through so much faster and doesn't trap people in the aisle when they're trying to go to the restroom I had never thought that doing away with the carts would be such a good idea but now I do", "This was my first time flying Jetblue Airways I have been flying many others such as United Delta etc but I have to say that my experience with Jetblue was so much better than other domestic airlines Their seats were much more comfortable leg space in economy class more than in another airlines I wasnt forced to check my carry on luggage as I usually am with United Flight departed and arrived on time In plane they have much wider choice of snacks plus you can ask for as many packages as you wish same with sodas All seats had small screens and I was able to watch TV channels for free They had about 37 complimentary channels basic news channels comedy etc The reason why i chose to try this airline was beacuse they had the lowest price for my selected travel dates and after this great experience I would fly with them again", "I had a positive experience with this airline I flew United Airlines down to Florida and I took Jetblue on the way back up As soon as I boarded Jetblue I noticed many differences from United and other legacy U S carriers Jetblue has much more legroom the seats are more comfortable entertainment is free staff are much more attentive and engaging and the complimentary snack selection is quite good", "JetBlue used to be a great airline 5 10 years ago but now they should be avoided JetBlue requires you to pay for your first checked bag and even more for the second bag I kept my bag below 50 pounds had accepted dimensions and they still charged me an extra 50 each way because it was traveling with unaccepted sports equipment As I am writing this they have announced that the plane needs maintenance and there will be a delay This has become a regular occurrence for this airline I fly jetblue very often and their quality deterioration over the years is pathetic", "We were flying from San Juan to Worcester MA with Jetblue Airways The flight from San Juan to Fort Lauderdale was delayed by 4 hours which would have had us miss our connecting flight to Worcester Gate agent got us on a flight through Orlando to Boston Logan made sure our bags were transferred and provided directions to get ground transportation from Logan to Worcester Upon arrival in Logan the agent was quick to provide a taxi voucher to Worcester and we were on our way This is an airline that goes above and beyond to get their customers to their final destination The unlimited snacks drinks live tv and wifi on board are also great", "Baltimore Washington BWI to Boston Logan We flew Jetblue because we wanted to see how it compared with other airlines like Southwest Jetblue is known for higher quality service so I was expecting a good experience Not so The flight itself was ok with great legroom and seats On the way up the weather was horrible in Boston so we were stuck in Baltimore for six hours Lunch vouchers of 10 dollars were distributed along with snacks I don't blame them for the delay totally but it did contribute to my attitude towards Jetblue on the return flight The flight up was cold even though it was winter They decided that AC was a good idea during winter Great idea Snacks were good though On the return flight we were scheduled for a nice afternoon evening flight but Jetblue decided to take our plane away from us fly it to JFK for another flight which they thought was more important than ours and left us sitting in the terminal for 3 4 more hours What a bad experience We met and chatted with some people to pass time which was entertaining but did not compensate for the time lost We got home at 11 30 p m when we were supposed to get home at 7 or so What was even worse was that the plane was even colder than the last flight Also the express service was offered so we got cold drinks in a cold plane with a small snack Great job Jetblue You are not at the top of my list of airlines I should fly in the future", "Flew into Ft Lauderdale from Turks and Caicos last evening to connect to a flight going to DCA When we 4 of us realized that our flight was delayed coming from Syracuse we went to a gate agent who was a tremendous help to us She managed to move us to an earlier flight and she also moved our baggage She was extremely friendly and accommodating Thank you", "Phoenix to New York JFK with JetBlue Airways They made me pay a ridiculous amount of 100 for overweight and another 60 for an extra piece of luggage that was medium size The funny thing is they somehow sent my bag that I paid extra for to Boston so I waited for my luggage for hours until they informed me that they would ship it to me I was told I would get some sort of compensation but I registered on the website to check and I got nothing Very disappointing but at least they didn't leave my suitcase a complete mess The flight itself was ok If it weren't for the luggage issue I'd probably have more positive things to say but I feel like I got royally screwed over What's important for them is that they got their money and that's how the rich get richer and the poor get poorer", "Bob Hope Burbank to Raleigh Durham via New York JFK JetBlue Airways agents displayed a lack of care when my second flight was cancelled last minute The agents at my initial departure location told me that it was due to a winter storm hitting New York City They also told me that my flight had been rescheduled for two days later which was a surprise to me as they never sent any sort of notification I demanded that I be flown out on the day of initial schedule and they rerouted me through a different flight from JFK When I arrived to JFK and spoke with an agent next to the gate where my original second flight was to depart I asked to be put on the next flight to Raleigh They said that it was full and nothing was available I asked why my initial flight had been cancelled and the agent told me that she didn't know I looked at the schedule board and my flight was one of three flights cancelled for the morning However I was told in Burbank that nearly all flights out of JFK for all airlines were cancelled due to inclement weather The communication with and at this airline is terrible They failed to inform me in a timely manner on why my flight was cancelled and for what reason When I pay a company substantial funds I expect a quality product in return That is something that I did not receive from JetBlue Also the floor of the aircraft had trash on it when I boarded in Burbank and the left arm of my seat with the built in remote control was falling apart This was my first and last flight experience with JetBlue", "Chicago to New York with jetBlue I waited 37 minutes on hold to get a hold of a rep on their 1 800 number and my cell died I got to a land line and as I type this I've been waiting 47 minutes This is unacceptable What a disgusting horrid way to treat people but I guess JetBlue doesn't care about their customer service", "Raleigh Durham to New York JFK I have never had a worse experience with flying On the way to JFK our flight was delayed 3 hours and on the way home our flight was canceled and delayed 24 hours It's not the delays and the cancellations that were the rub though it was the customer service throughout the complications Never spoke to ruder employees who could not care less about customer inconvenience I even spoke to a supervisor at one point and was left more angry than before I did I usually fly Delta or American but was looking to save a few bucks with JetBlue but discovered the hard way that when it comes down to it those few bucks are not worth the pain aggravation and frustration of dealing with a discount airlines customer service department They really just don't care about making you a happy loyal customer", "JetBlue from Nassau to Fort Lauderdale The check in process was nice and short and boarding process a breeze The flight attendants were happy they gave out a variety of snacks but since the flight is a short 30 minutes we only got water which was very acceptable There was also flight entertainment system The bagging system was very fast", "New York to San Francisco JetBlue are a great airline I like that they have challenged the airline norms and created their own flight experience If only more airlines would do this The plane was modern clean and simple perfect for a short haul flight The staff were friendly the seats comfortable for a domestic flight and the flight was pleasant I liked the individual attention when ordering food and beverage not like the usual trolleys in cattle class I would fly this airline again ahead of many others", "Ft Lauderdale to Detroit return with Jetblue The boarding agents at Ft Lauderdale were not helpful I had a seat but my husband did not and they would not seat us together without us paying more because they only had more leg room seats available Not a good experience with the check in agents at Ft Lauderdale When we left Detroit the agents were nicer", "The Jetblue flight from Buffalo to Boston was cheap and they have good service as well The ground staff were very friendly During the flight you get something to drink and some snacks The entertainment is awesome and on yor personal display you can watch films and you can recieve the TV programmes too The seat are big and comfortable", "The first time I fly Jetblue I decided to give it a try because of the landing airport IAD and the scheduled time a late night departure with still plenty of time for me to connect on an international overnight flight on a different airline I have to recognize that flight attendants are helpful attentive and approachable captain made at least four announcements during taxi and in flight regarding ETA Entertainment on the plane also was great and provided plenty of options even for a flight this short It is a pity that the superb service on the plane did little to offset my initial impression after security check and before boarding The flight arrived into IAD just in time for me to run from opposite ends in IAD terminals to catch an overnight connecting flight luckily I had only a carry on and no terminal change was required The thing is I left with the impression that the airline did little to expedite our boarding process could have anticipated boarding for 15 or so minutes at least showing no care for its passengers time gate It is a shame to have a superb service on board paired with a negative experience in the airline's main hub", "I flew Jetblue from Cleveland to Ft Lauderdale on Dec 30 2015 and was pleasantly surprised at the amount of legroom in economy The plane was clean and spacious I was also surprised to see a decent selection of snacks offered for free as well as soft drinks tonics seltzers and tomato juice Compared to other low cost airlines this is a bonus The flight encountered some gulp worthy turbulence but the staff was quite friendly and accommodating The same was true for the return flight from Ft Lauderdale to Cleveland Again the turbulence but everything else was smooth We even landed ahead of time I would recommend Jetblue", "Jetblue Airways from Albuquerque to New York JFK return The cabin crew and flight crews excellent and on both legs they went out of their way to make a long cramped flight as comfortable as they could There is scant service on board Complimentary snacks and soft drinks if you want anything stronger you have to pay The interiors of the aircraft were old and tired looking the seats were hard and rigid with the smallest of recline even in Extra Space an interior upgrade would be good Paying 20 00 for a checked bag seems somewhat counterproductive At the gate the ground crew was asking people to check bags in for free because the fights were full Wouldn't it be better to encourage everyone to check their bags for free in the first place and not penalize those of us who try to do the right thing by checking our bags The long uncomfortable flights were made more acceptable with the seat back screens and satellite TV and free Wi Fi Apart from JetBlue's excellent crews these made the flights a lot better", "Have been sitting in the Buffalo airport since 6 30pm for a 9pm flight This flight is only an hour in duration Currently it is 11pm and they have been slowly pushing the departure time back half an hour at a time Now it is schedule for 11 30pm departure it will probably be pushed back again and then cancelled altogether because clearly they have nothing better to do then waste all of our time Not a single announcement has been made about the flight status The JetBlue personnel are standing around gossiping and laughing We have to regularly check the monitor for flight updates The ticketing agent who checked us in said and I quote don't go too far from the gate the status might change in an instant and they will leave without you Called JetBlue the CSR told me it was due to air traffic control reasons Fantastic start to my vacation so far", "There was only 3 minutes left to board the plane due to the amount of people at security we rush through JFK to the JetBlue area They check in our bags we ask if we are not too late They say we are but they hold the plane for us and we run to the Embraer 190 as fast as we could This was really kind of the staff The overall inflight experience was amazing good staff good legroom and very nice staff taking care of the customers", "My second flight ever on JetBlue wasn't initially such a great success We were just about to take off when the pilot says we have engine problems and had to taxi back to the gate After several hours of waiting on the plane and in the terminal they announced the flight was canceled and that it would depart the next afternoon Despite the frustration by this JetBlue handled the situation extremely well The pilot and crew kept us informed continually When we knew we had to overnight they arranged rooms at the Renaissance hotel close by and gave us vouchers for meals By email we immediately received apology emails and bonus vouchers for future flights When we finally departed the next day we had an A320 that had different seats than our inbound brand new A321 Same concept but much older seats and screen Despite all that the flight was pleasurable and delivered on its LCC formula It is definitely worth to pay the extra for extra legroom", "My family and I were going to California for an event and so we decided to use the one domestic airline that we'd used before that we actually liked Jetblue Airways We usually fly to Europe with SWISS and so we have a high standard when it comes to flights Jetblue Airways met and exceeded those expectations Terminal 5 their new hub at JFK is spectacular Everyone was extremely friendly there were no lines boarding was on time and there were lots of things to see in the terminal On board the crew had a great sense of humor and they were efficient in distributing the variety of free snacks on board I also bought one of their 'EatUp boxes since I was hungry and it was very high quality I had plenty of entertainment they give you free access to DirectTV through the screen in front of you in addition to free SiriusXM satellite radio and free WiFi That's pretty darn good by any airline's standard The plane we were on was also one of their new Airbus A321s so that certainly helped We got to LAX ahead of schedule The only U S airline I genuinely enjoy flying on", "Jetblue Airways from Boston Logan to Washington Boarding was orderly the plane was clean and the crew pleasant and seems happy to help The short flight had a complimentary snack and drinks service which was a nice touch The snacks comprised of a vegetable or beef pastry option The crew serving the front half of the plane was very pro active customer service oriented and communicative", "Flew Jetblue Airways from LGB to LAS on A320 Long Beach airport does not use a Jet Bridge so you have to embark and disembark the aircraft using stairs or a ramp Cabin crew had a great sense of humor and reminded me of Southwest Airlines Wifi worked extremely well Even during a short 50 minute flight JetBlue served drinks pretzels and chocolate chip cookies", "I have flown Jetblue several times over the last year and have been very happy with the experience Recently I had booked some flights to and from NY as part of a trip I was planning on to Rome and Paris Unfortunately a few days before departure my wife sustained an injury forcing us to cancel all of my flights and hotels The quality of a company may be seen in its truest light when they do things that are not easily seen Jet Blue was very understanding of my legitimate medical reason for not traveling supplied doctors info and letter etc and promptly I mean on the phone provided me with a travel credit that I can use anywhere anytime within one year No third degree they just did it Lufthansa came through as well compare that with what I got from Iberia which was essentially sorry use them or lose them Jetblue are very classy", "I really enjoyed the Jetblue experience and as an early birthday present I decided to upgrade to even more legroom The check in experience could have been a bit faster but I am a super early check in type so it didn't bother me that much I think Portland security needs to be a bit better The direct tv onboard made the flight enjoyable and so did the FA's I really enjoyed this trip", "Cleveland to Ft Lauderdale with Jetblue Good airplane and nice seats The flight attendants were rude to passengers that were a few minutes late and complained like children It was embarrassing for the airline I was very impressed with everything else They told us over the PA to clap for the late passengers to embarrass them Childish It's a shame that they were so rude", "On our way back home from the Dominican Republic our plane to New York was delayed about 6 hours When we first heard this we were so upset because they only have one plane that comes into that small airport but they quickly worked out a plan to get us home They were going to put us in a hotel overnight in New York but I am a critical care nurse and could not miss any more days of work Right when they heard this they switched our connecting flight and even changed our destination from San Diego to LAX They comped our taxi ride gave us food vouchers and even a coupon for our next flight with them They made a very stressful situation run so smoothly They lady at the desk in LAX knew how to be patient with people She was so helpful and sweet We will for sure be flying with Jetblue on future flights", "This is a low cost airline who I thought were a little different from the rest unfortunately not I wanted to change a flight and instead of charging me the current difference in price they wanted to look back at the price I paid for the fare and the price now If they said we will charge you the difference in airfare at the time of booking then fine but they wanted to charge the difference of a fare booked weeks in advance hence cheaper and the cost of the new flight which departed in 24 hours The flight I was booked on was exactly the same cost as the one I wanted to change to but these cowboys wanted to basically steal money from me to get something that was of exactly the same value Small airline generally stay just that because they haven't the foresight or sense of customer satisfaction the market leaders have When I asked to be put through to their customer service department I was told the person I was speaking to was it Rude abrupt and totally devoid of any sense of what is right and unwilling to help All I got was it is in the terms and conditions which very few of us read but do expect like all good companies are reasonable and fair", "Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas This was my first time flying JetBlue and my experience was positive The flight left on time and arrived early into Las Vegas I had no issue with the flight or service Monday night football was on which many were enjoying on their IFE and the game literally ended as we pulled up to the gate the timing could not have been better JetBlue does charge for bags which I paid And from the time I booked the flight to the time I left the price of the flight only went up as it should", "I was expecting my flight from New York JFK to Los Angeles on JetBlue to be a more budget friendly business class option I was wrong Mint is a fantastic design and is superior to many First Class options on other US airlines The flight attendants were very friendly and the food was great Will definitely fly JetBlue in future", "I hardly ever do reviews but today I flew into St Georges Grenada from JFK and absolutely had to let Jetblue know how amazing one of their staff was Kelly at check in not only expedited my very time rushed transit but also personally brought me an important folder I had left at the counter right into the plane before take off You're a superstar and I will definitely be paying it forward Thank you so much JetBlue you're lucky to have such an amazing employee", "Flew from DC to Boston for the marathon this year It was only an hour gate to gate which was one of the shortest flights I've ever flown They had seatback TVs that played around 35 channels The flight attendants weren't very interesting Served soda and snacks including peanuts chips and cookies Good service overall Bumpy though because there was a storm over Cape Cod Very cheap but overall it was a very good flight", "First time on JetBlue and I can now see what the fuss is about They're excellent We paid extra for the 'Even More space' seats and it was worth it Never have had so much leg room on an economy class seat which is important on this 4 30 hour flight from New York to Aruba The service was great the IFE system fantastic and the A321 plane was close to new The internet worked for part of the flight and was quite fast for being airborne it only works over US air space although would be great if it worked for the entire duration of the flight The only improvement required is the food menu On such a long flight they should have something more substantial to eat than a processed cheese pack or pretzels", "I must admit as a UK resident I had had some dread about using Jetblue as I had expected they would be a US equivalent of Ryanair However they turned out to be just fine Booked online weeks in advance checked in at the airport all very quick and efficient flights exactly on time Big seats and legroom more than on the international flights we took I'll give them a 9 even though they left my case in San Francisco the airport's fault not theirs as they got it into the hotel in Las Vegas the same night and provided e mail updates several times during the process Really surprised by how nice it was to fly with them", "The flight from New York to Las Vegas was fine Nothing special but nothing horrible My real problem with Jetblue was regarding my flight home I had a flight booked from Las Vegas back to New York on a Sunday night at 9 15 pm At around 6 00 pm on that Sunday I received an email not from Jetblue but from expedia the site I used to book the flight The email said that Jetblue had made changes to my flight without even notifying me themselves I was told by expedia to call them right away and was told that my flight was canceled Expedia tried to get me on another flight that night Expedia not the airline of which I was a customer Expedia informed me that Jetblue had no other fights that night and I would have to fly out in the afternoon the next day I could not do that I had no money to spend on another hotel stay for the night I was already checked out of my previous hotel and ready to go home I thought in the least Jetblue would accommodate me with a free hotel stay for the night but they were not accommodating in any way whatsoever They did not reassure me that they would at least try to get me back on another flight that night no hotel stay nothing Luckily some friends I was with managed to get us a flight that night on Virgin America But Jetblue had no compassion were completely uncaring towards me and my two other friends who were on that same canceled flight I was told with much attitude to calm down over the phone multiple times They were also completely useless when my parents called them from New York trying to fix my situation That is no way to treat a customer I am never flying with Jetblue again", "We departed October 7th to visit San Juan Puerto Rico When we checked in they assigned me a seat but not my sister The agent said they will assign her a seat at the gate Totally confused about that we checked everything in and when we got to the gate we explained to the agent for some reason one of us didn't get a seat assignment We then asked if we could be reassigned to sit together They first offered us the last seats on the plane we didn't want those if we didn't have too After about 5 minutes we had seats in the extra room section Very pleased with our area lots of room Our interaction with 2 flight attendants was outstanding and made the flight a delight Thanks Jetblue for great first time experience", "I wasted a trip to New York I booked Jetblue Airways flight from Orlando to New York as I thought they were good The delays totally wasted this trip to New York and I will never fly with Jetblue again", "Flew JetBlue from Boston to San Juan return Check in via kiosk the app was not working was fast in both directions and bag drop lines were not too bad finished in about 5 minutes Seats onboard were comfortable the service onboard was fast and pleasant Flights were on time All in all a more than acceptable first and second experience with this airline", "I had my trip set for September 24 to fly out from LAX box to FL Airport and was supposed to return September 29 which was perfect for my Vacation but things didn't go as planned My wife called Friday to tell me that my son was in the Hospital I didn't think twice so I called Jetblue to catch the next fight out I know I had to pay extra but I didn't care I was prepared to spend whatever I had to They really took care of me I will always fly jetblue", "I paid the extra 70 to upgrade to an even more room To me it was well worth it because I had to book late and the alternative was a seat in the middle of a row down the back For the money you get loads of leg room actually plenty for a tall man and you get to sit right up front At boarding you are one of the first on so you don't have to fight for bin space I was in 2F so I didn't have far to walk JetBlue offers free WiFi which you can use for normal access but you can't download large files unless you want to spend more on the upgraded service All I wanted was to be able to send progress messages It worked for that but it wasn't particularly fast I had a look at the free entertainment but to me it was rubbish Just the usual low brow low life shows I wouldn't watch on TV This is why I don't have cable TV any more Alaska is a lot better Food is snacks if you don't want 100 calorie packs then bring something with you Don't do what one low life did nobody wants to share a plane with a burger and fries The flight was uneventful and landed on time", "A round trip in Jetblue Mint Class Both flights were exceptional in every way from start to finish Seats staff food and entertainment really the most enjoyable domestic service I have experienced in years Only complaint and it is minor there was no lounge Jetblue is doing business class right Major legacy carriers take note if you want to survive", "Terrible customer service with Jetblue Airways I purposely selected a return flight on a specific day However the reservations somehow were changed to the day after The two flights were identical in price time and airport At first we attempted to change the flight Ignoring the 90 fee they wanted to charge an extra 270 per flight though the flights are the same price currently and when we booked them Their website states we will honor the lower fare This is a lie We then tried to fly stand by but they would not allow this either The flight was not full either and it is highly unlikely to fill many seats the day of the flight All I can say is that they have lost a customer for life", "I flew on JetBlue's new A321 and was very impressed The seats were very comfortable for economy snacks and drinks they give were great and the staff was friendly Out of the airlines I've flown on JetBlue has been my favorite", "Normally I'm a big Jetblue supporter however my last trip really shows me how much the customer service quality has dropped It was once a pleasure to fly with them now like most other airlines it had gone back to becoming a terrible experience Although my bag fit in the designated carry on box they specified they refused to let me carry it on and forced me to pay for a checked bag This after my flight being canceled the previous day and forcing to rearrange my schedule Above all else it was the lack of customer service or any polite attitude to a loyal customer", "We bought 2 Jetblue tickets from Seattle to New York We did the online check in 23h before the departure and our assigned places in the aircraft were 22E for my husband and 24B for me BOTH in the middle Even though we bought the tickets together and we were assigned 2 rows apart we thought we could handle this situation at the airport as we did before with other airlines We arrived at the airport and went to the check in counter to speak with someone The lady there told us that there is nothing to do if we don't upgrade our seats for an 80 fee as it looks like we bought the last two tickets and these were the last two places When we arrived to the gate the gentleman there said please come here if you don't have a seat assigned on your ticket in order to give you one And that was the moment I realized we were fooled by this company We went there and asked how can we have bought the last 2 tickets in this aircraft and have the last two spots in the middle if there are people with no seat assigned And he just told me I said you can upgrade for 80 if you don't just have a nice trip bye They were rude and impolite they didn't solve our problem and it was clear that they have a software that automatically assigns you and your partner far apart just to upgrade and pay more money None of us was assigned at the window or the aisle because it's harder to switch places in the aircraft with someone if you are assigned in the middle if one of us would have had aisle or window seat would have been much easier Overall we were very disappointed and angry because they don't have the desire to help you Even the tablets inside the aircraft have a swipe slot to be able to pay if you want to use them", "After asking the customer service agent at the gate why we were delayed he responded rudely and treated me as I was stupid for not hearing a pilot announcement I was sitting by the gate the whole time and didn't hear an announcement From there I went to customer service to see what the deal was as well as let them know that the man at the gate was not friendly at all The service agent was friendly and gave dinner vouchers for the inconvenience I was thankful When I boarded after the flight was delayed twice there wasn't room on the plane for my computer bag The flight attendant told me I would have to check it After I suggested that we see if people can put a small bag under the seat in front of them he responded saying that my bag would be checked in a rude fashion He said he didn't have to deal with me and called security Not only is that not called for as I was no threat to anyone but embarrassing The security guard came down and even told the flight attendant that everything seemed fine The flight attendant got the pilot and told him he didn't want me on the plane I am currently sleeping at the airport and can't get home until tomorrow now I am upset and embarrassed and the show the flight attendant put on I was frustrated about the delay and bag situation but certainly was not any kind of threat The security guard have me a cot to sleep on He was very nice As I am writing I am sleepless in NYC feeling violated and disappointed in the way humans treat other humans It's not okay to treat other people this way", "I was positively surprised by the quality of Jetblue Airways on my flight from Long Beach to Anchorage Both seat reservatations and luggage were complimentary Staff was very attentive and a good selection of food and drinks were offered Compared to other US airlines the entertainment system is supreme live TV and a variety of movies can be watched On top of that the WiFi was working properly throughout the whole flight", "So everything was fine for our 11 00pm Jetblue Airways departure to Fort Lauderdale The inbound plane arrived a little late and we saw the ground crew who was also the ticket counter crew scurrying around At 11 00 p m one of the staff announced something in Spanish and you could hear some people groan Fortunately there was a bi lingual person near us who said They just cancelled the flight With that Jetblue announced the flight was cancelled at 11 30 pm and all passengers on our flight were to proceed to Gate XYZ so we did Once there the non English speaking staff asked for our passports and wisked them away An hour later they were returned to us haphazardly and we were told to stand in line for buses no explanation given but found out we were to be taken to Baggage Claim to get our luggage We did and got our bags Then we lined up again not knowing what for to get on buses to take us to a hotel It was now 2 00 am so we complied We got to the hotel and waited in line again to get a room We were told we would be taken to the airport at 1 30 to board our flight After an awesome breakfast not kidding we were told we would be taken to the airport at 8 30 Then we got an email saying we were booked on the 11 00 pm flight But leaving at 8 30 wouldn't be enough time We called our travel agent who advised us to just go to the airport and demand to leave We did and Jetblue got us out Came to find out the flight we were supposed to be on didn't leave until 6 30 the following morning Jetblue gave us credits etc but if they are going to introduce new destination they have to staff the counters with competent staff who can communicate effectively with the passengers In the future we will never travel with Jetblue to a destination that is new to them Just not worth the risk", "There is only one direct flight that works for traveling on Friday evenings and it's the 8 10pm flight out of Fort Lauderdale I usually fly first class US Airways around 7 30pm but because this is a direct flight and gets me home much earlier I've been attempting to use it Key word attempting I've had three weddings to attend in Pittsburgh the past two weekends one now and two in the previous weeks for the third week in a row my flight is delayed Not due to weather not due to mechanics just because the woman at the counter said It's not delayed just by a little bit we're talking hours When I schedule a specific time to fly I expect to fly on time and if something comes up where the flight won't be on time I expect to be informed and to be given alternative options Not once have I received an email a phone call a text or even an apology Unfortunately for the third week in a row JetBlue has failed to value my business and my time I will get the lovely privilege of spending just a little over 24 hours in my home state miss my business meeting that was scheduled for tonight Not worth my money and especially not worth my time", "JetBlue continues to be our airline of choice when flying domestic Check in in Boston should have been a bit faster but overall this was an enjoyable experience We opted for the Even More Space seats which offer 4 5 extra inches of legroom in rows 1 5 and 10 11 We also got priority boarding which is always nice JetBlue's entertainment helped make the 6 1 2 hour flight seem like 1 hour Their map is always helpful too Due to the limited amount of flights JetBlue operates out of San Francisco they only have 2 gates and they are both in the international terminal so we had to walk pretty far to get to baggage claim Once again did not disappoint", "I am mostly writing this review for the ground service and checking in our bags Disclaimer however we were traveling with firearms but even still it took an absurd amount of time We waited in line for about 30 minutes wondering what was taking so long but as soon as we got to the counter we figured out why all the agents were in training with the supervisor skipping from one to the other We had to first check our firearms and it was clear that the attendent didn't know the slightest about the procedure as he asked the manager after every time he clicked the screen I had been through the process before I had it prepped but I still had to open and close the case multiple times Then after deciding it was oversize we were charged 135 for the one bag just for being oversize and a second bag Overall I would not fly Jetblue again due to incompetent staff and ridiculous fees", "Friendly staff comfortable clean aircraft and great selection of complementary refreshments on board One complaint is a small delay from JFK but other than that the Jetblue experience was pleasant", "On time lots of leg room choice of free snacks free TV and movies outside lower 48 efficient crew fare cheapest on this sector Only downside ads against possible increase in taxes for airline passengers Would fly again", "Mint seats are great Attentive staff excellent service great seats new planes lovely food What's not to like Only issue is LAX airport is seriously grim and there didn't appear to be a lounge Book and have a great flight", "We travelled from Orlando to New York JFK on JetBlue Airways and I would like to congratulate the crew and the airline The crew were very kind to us and we felt that they gave us special attention which made our journey a very pleasant one Thank you and we definitely will travel with you again and highly recommend you", "Unable to handle problems our flight was delayed then cancelled Staff not able to communicate clearly Any problems and this airline falls apart Had to wait until next day to fly out", "We travelled to Orlando from the UK for a week stay then decided that we wanted to visit Mexico So we went to a JetBlue travel desk within Orlando International and booked a return ticket to Cancun The staff were helpful at the desk and the whole boarding procedure was quick and straightforward On board our seats were roomy there was free wifi and TV's in the seat for a 1hour 50min flight We even received a free drink and snack My husband watched football I thought the cabin crew were presented well and they seem to have much more personality than any other airline I have recently travelled on I was amazed that Jetblue is considered Budget as it is in a whole other league to the UK budget airline Easyjet I would fly with them again", "First time flying with jetblue and will fly again Thanks for a comfortable flight", "Both flights to Puerto Rico and back were pleasant On time and services were great However on my way back home I had a back injury that flared up during the trip and the people from Jetblue were great in assisting me with a wheelchair from beginning to end I will definately recommend them and use their service in the future", "Twice a year for 9 years my wife and I fly to family in California and it is a full day trip We are both handicapped and it has always been hard on us and we were always made to feel like a burden by airlines employees This year we took Jetblue for the nonstop flight even though Boston airport is over an hours drive Customer service addressed our special needs from the very start with booking the flight over the phone to finish getting our luggage there and back home and I didn't feel helpless about having a disability", "My Jetblue flight was canceled 2 hourse before departure They rescheduled me on a flight 7 hours later and I found a flight on another airline The return was on Jetblue When I went online to select a seat I was presented with a grand total of 0 seats from which to chose without paying the upgrade fee How could there be 0 seats when I don't have one Next flight planned a couple of weeks in advance Go online to pick a seat 0 seats available I don't get a seat until I get to the airport last row middle seat On the return leg I go online again and zip So I call customer service After 10 minutes on hold I explain and am told that it's because I got on the site late Well it's not a problem you'll get a seat Sure I will last row middle perhaps After a few minutes of snarky attitude I ask for a supervisor Literally 25 minutes later I hung up without ever speaking to a supervisor", "We fly JetBlue about 3 times a year and every time it's satisfying The legroom is great in even more space the television is great for entertainment and they actually give you something more than peanuts Also every here and there the flight is over two hours and you can get eat up's which include cheese up meat up and many more", "MSY to BOS on 6th July I was initially confused and frustrated by the online check in process they assign seats upon arrival at the gate and you can only reserve online if you wish to pay for 'More Space' seats in advance Both the phone and Twitter operatives were helpful when I raised this with them We arrived at the gate with about an hour to spare gate staff could not have been more helpful We asked to have two seats together and were told that this would be resolved once the staff had logged in 15 minutes later we were called to the desk and found that we had been assigned to More Legroom at no extra cost We were delighted with this and the seats were very comfortable We also loved the DirectTv and Sirius Radio live streaming to the aircraft a unique touch The unlimited soft drinks and snacks were appreciated The flight staff were attentive and approachable The captain coming out to make the pre flight briefing personally was a great touch There was an on ground delay of an hour due to bad weather in Washington but the captain kept us fully informed of everything that was going on and since they had the foresight to switch the entertainment on prior to take off why doesn't every airline do that we barely noticed", "Our flight was delayed because of a mechanical error and I was okay until they suggested my family of 4 go on a flight the next day It was our first vacation in 3 years and my dad saved up 3 years worth of vacation days for this trip They offered to give us Jetblue vouchers Period Our hotel rental car and vacation plan fees were thrown down the toilet and they only offered vouchers Like I'll ever ride on Jetblue again Also they acted like they were doing a huge favor by saying our delayed flight was paid by them We didn't get a refund so we just paid for a later flight This infuriated me and I tried to explain that it wasn't free for us and the woman from Jetblue kept saying it was paid by them So I asked if I could get a refund for the original flight and they said no I was so mad but couldn't cancel because of the fees for hotel car food and other reservations weren't refundable It was just an overall horrible experience and ended up in two of us in tears", "Comically mismanaged operation Problems began when the departure gate was mobbed seems an earlier flight had 'technical problems' so it departed an hour late at my original gate We were then redirected to an alternate gate and waited And waited And waited They now had us waiting on the plane with 'technical problems' and they basically had the other flight go out with our intended jet and we were stuck It took text message from my daughter thousands of miles away to inform me the flight was finally cancelled Not one word from JetBlue staff at the boarding gate Finally 2 hours after scheduled departure they announced baggage was at the carousel and being monitored by JetBlue associates I went down to claim my bag no JetBlue staff in sight I quickly went to ticketing got an apology and refund from the embarrassed support staff and proceeded to Southwest where I ended up having to pay 500 more for their next direct flight with a confirmed seat I understand this is a mechanical industry and there will be problems but it's how an airline manages the problem that is a mark of their business integrity and customer focus How a major airline doesn't keep a backup vessel on site is mind boggling to me let alone the abject lack of communication to the paying customer", "It was the first time my children had flown so I wanted it to be good From the beginning JetBlue kept me happy I had TSA precheck when we arrived and I didn't ask for it When we boarded the plane we boarded first because we had a small child There was no extra charge for this Our flight took off 20 min early so we arrived early During the flight we were quickly offered snacks and a drink The attendant came around selling ear buds for 5 to use with the TV at each seat Having your own TV made the flight enjoyable At the end of the flight deplaning was just as pleasant The price was also better than anyone else and there were no problems with my luggage One more thing my very picky husband who is 6'3 had plenty of legroom We did not upgrade to even more space but he still had plenty of legroom and was very comfortable in a normal seat", "It started out good with complimentary baggage check drink and a snack however on the return flight things quickly changed to bad Beware of cheap flights you pay for what you get Flight delayed an hour then sat for 2 hours due to mechanical reasons This company is not considerate of customers or handicap customers and worst they do not partner with domestic airlines only international airlines therefore if you miss your flight you are out of luck until the next one The best you are getting is a food voucher", "On a flight back to Detroit Metro Airport from Boston Logan May 28 2015 First while we waited to board the flight the woman at counter announced We are having trouble locating our flight crew sorry for the delay about 15 min at this time Another 10 min goes by and she announces We know our crew is here somewhere because they flew in we hope it is just a few more min The third time she said we have located our crew and it should only be about 10 15 more min until boarding We finally board the plane and we never hear from our captain until prepare for landing I have never been on a flight that I didn't hear from the captain before during and just before landing", "Flight s from CHS to DCA and back Not allowed to select seat assignment when checking in online evening before flights unless paying for premium seats poor attitude from airline staff at DCA when I expressed frustration While speaking with an agent another interrupted the conversation offering his unsolicited opinion Funny seated dead last group 3 in last available seat Coincidence Please note staff at CHS very kind", "Flew from SFO JFK and return flight on JetBlue Both flights left on time and we arrived at both destinations about 30 minutes early The crew on the flight was attentive and very friendly Both on the way to New York and back to SF they asked us about ourselves and our trip The A321 they fly on trans con flights has a snack bar they open up after they come through with the first round of drinks It's great being able to get up and get your own snacks without having to call a flight attendant The entertainment was pretty standard they have live TV and movies you can purchase for 5 The flight crew were also informative We had a pretty intense bout of turbulence but the captain continued to update passengers the whole time", "The seat and legroom were excellent On our flight to Puerto Rico from Chicago we felt the cabin crew were less than exceptional Drinks came but the snack food service was much later They didn't pick up the refuse for a long time We didn't sense that the crew enjoyed their jobs The entertainment controls did not function on either of our seats We were not able to take advantage of the entertainment On the return leg of our trip the crew was marginally better We purchased headphones but after about an hour my aisle seat controls stopped working my wife's center seat controls never worked at all We were happy with the overall flight otherwise It was nice to be able to get more than a tiny bag of peanuts", "LAX BOS A320 Boarding zones were a bit strung out although not helped by the people who would show up to the gate as boarding was going on but should have sped it up On board everything went smoothly Quick to take off so was must not have lost our slot Crew was above par and standard Jetblue entertainment product and snacks At least one lady in the row in front of me had a TV that did not work so they reset the system Not a big deal but if you purchased content and already watching that would be a huge pain Going to miss when they reduce the pitch as the 34' current is great Arrived slightly early but the crew seemed a bit disinterested to passengers as departing However minor point 9 10", "Flight 906 on 3 17 and 905 on 3 22 I booked a trip to NYC from Chicago and I chose JetBlue based on price and time of flight Since I'm a student and I was on a budget and I mainly based my decision on price It was 220 round trip I had really low expectations given that this airline is not a big name like others out there but I'm happy to say I had an excellent experience Both my flights were on time they offered free snacks no peanuts here legit snacks and soda tea coffee The service and the whole experience was great I would definitely recommend JetBlue", "My husband and I decided to take a spontaneous trip to San Francisco for my birthday As we were making travel arrangements to return back to the Miami area JetBlue had the only flight that worked with our time schedule We were hesitant to book the flight with JetBlue because we did not know much about the company We decided to give JetBlue a chance and booked flight #578 from SFO to FLL on March 14 2015 It is unfortunate that we did not have a good experience on our first JetBlue flight The electrical system had issues The TV on the back of the seats worked at the beginning of the flight but slowly the TVs started going out throughout the cabin our row did not have a working TV the majority of the 5 hour flight This made me question what other electrical issues this plane might have Not only did we have electrical issues but we did not have running water on the flight My husband and I are both in the medical field and we feel this is not only inconvenient but unsanitary The solution was to place multiple bottles of water in the restroom for customers to wash their hands Partially used and soiled water bottles to wash our hands is not exactly our idea of sanitary Since the plane did not have running water my husband and I decided to avoid using the restroom for over a 5 hour flight It also made us question the cleanliness of the flight attendants' hands provided the lack of water on the plane This is a huge unsanitary issue that should never occur on a plane", "I chose JetBlue because I heard great things I think I had an unlucky streak in which both of my flights were delayed One being a leaky valve and the second due to weather out of JetBlues control JetBlue worked really hard to keep me happy and remain their customer They provided me a credit no questions asked since the delays affected my transportation routes For them to do that shows that this type of thing does not happen very often I will also say that the unlimited snacks beverages not to mention all the leg room was a plus Although I did not have a perfect experience I would definitely recommend JetBlue Things happen but JetBlue owns up to it and works hard to keep you a satisfied customer I respect that and their business model of good customer service I bet if I didn't have the delays the experience would have been perfect", "We just did the Jetblue Mint experience LAX to JFK We are a couple of airline geeks who took this flight as a Valentines Day gift to each other Our dedicated Mint flight crew greeted us warmly during boarding including a welcome card with their names Also waiting at our seats were eye masks and bottled water Before takeoff we each enjoyed a couple of their delicious signature drinks they're small After takeoff we were offered more drinks a Birchbox full of gender specific spa products and dinner Out of 5 or 6 items we were permitted to choose 3 small plates an appetizer and dessert Honestly I found some of the food excellent and some not quite as good They were more than happy to replace one of my choices that I wasn't too happy with The entertainment was great live TV and free wifi The movies are not on demand which made it so that I wasn't able to watch one because I was too distracted with the rest of the Mint experience to pay attention to the start times In case dinner doesn't fill you the A321 has a self serve snack bar behind the Mint cabin for anytime bagged snacks and drinks The seats themselves were comfortable for a 5 hour domestic flight I liked the firmness controls and massage feature We sat in a 2 seat bank so we could sit together but the single suites looked very nice for people traveling alone The single seats have more personal space and a privacy door too Jetblue really thought our the Mint product well If you book enough in advance the introductory price is a terrific value Even last minute bookings still price Mint competitively with UA DL and AA on this route", "I was scheduled to leave at 8 35 am There was an issue with the plane and the flight was delayed until 10 00am We were finally on the plane when the flight was cancelled due to weather The flight would have made it if we had left on time the DC airport closed at 1 00 pm I was rebooked for a new flight the following day The flight left at 1 00 pm took me to Boston then arrived in DC at 10 00pm My original flight was direct I was told the airline would not provide accommodations for the night because it was a weather and not a technical difficulty that cancelled the flight of course the weather only became an issue because of the technical difficulty I went back to the airport early the following morning and was able to book a direct flight to DC that departed at 6 55 I tried to fly standby on the two earlier flight without success Although this is terrible the worst part was the gate agents They didn't have the decency to tell me that the flight was full and just walked away from the desk after boarding the flight Then when I checked in for my 6 55 flight I hadn't been assigned a seat that morning they were rude again I will not fly JetBlue again", "Flew jetBlue Mint class New York to LA and return Overall a great experience Was seated in 2A one of four 'single suites ' Very comfortable and private especially when reclined with the suite door closed The only picky comment is there tends to be some wasted space owing to the single seat configuration and the design could have accommodated a greater seat width You're also removed from the window so mindless gazing is not really an option unless you unbuckle and lean The perks in Mint are outstanding not just the lie flat seat with massage feature but the food and beverage selection amenity kit service from the flight staff and the large video screen As mentioned in previous reviews not touch screen but that didn't really detract from the experience you couldn't even reach the screen necessarily when fully reclined Okay selection of feature films but not VOD The DirecTV feed is great however and really gives no reason to claim you're bored The wi fi complimentary at the moment was hit and miss fairly good responsiveness when working but did suffer from numerous interruptions Personalized and attentive service was prominent on both legs and flight time seemingly flew no pun intended by At the current introductory price point Mint is outstanding value Inevitably jetBlue will adjust their fare pricing to reflect the reality of what is offered however even at a higher cost Mint class should be seriously considered before looking at intercontinental business class on other airlines jetBlue and its staff should be proud of the Mint product and I will look for any excuse to fly Mint class again", "Buffalo to New York JFK with a connection to Los Angeles read the latter segment under a separate review The flight from Buffalo left and arrived on time The Even More Space seats are very good with plenty of leg room while also providing the benefit of early boarding Flight crew was personable and attentive As a first timer with JetBlue I was impressed Will definitely fly with them again Great alternative to a Canadian airline out of Toronto for me", "JFK LAX Mint Service Like other reviews of this new First Class Jet blue service it is excellent Overall it ranked higher than most excellent business class carriers and felt more like BA First which I had just flew in on The level of the service is high as well as the experience Meals are better than most carriers and was completely impressed What I liked the most was the Suite which was private and comfortable with plenty of room for a bed with great bedding Was completely surprised by this level of service in US The only downside was the movies were not running but there was plenty of other options The amenities kit and head set are all top notch They give American and Virgin a run for the money and considering this service is so well priced I will be flying again", "In December 2014 I took two separate jetBlue flights one from SFO to JFK and then another from JFK to LAX These flights were fairly long 5 hours and I found the service to be quite sterile and mediocre While it was nice that snacks and drinks were made available throughout the flight there were no healthy options aside from water and if you were not prepared to purchase a meal on board chips and cookies were basically your only options for the flight I feel that this is standard for a flight that may be 1 or 2 hours long but for a longer 5 hour trip I expect there to be meal service included in the price of the fare I also suffered from severe pain in my right ear during and after landing on both these flights which I had not experienced on another domestic US flight with a different airline that I had taken around the same time nor on any other flight I have had prior or after these two jetBlue ones", "Just arrived in NYC LGA from Fort Myers with my 3 kids and husband We were really impressed by our experiences on outgoing and returning flights Great satisfaction with all aspects of travel boarding inflight service healthy food and beverage choices entertainment communication service spacious seats and storage", "JFK IAD ERJ 195 The seat is nice and provides enough legroom It was a short flight of about 50 minutes There were personal TV which is good enough for a short flight You can switch channels to news such as CNN The flight has snacks and cola for complimentary It is the best experience I have had on short flight", "R T JFK to LIR Liberia Costa Rica in Even More Space seats The EMS seats entitle you to shorter waiting time at the TSA checkpoint which we needed since we were a little late arriving to JFK We purchased food to bring on board but boxes are availlable No Eat Up Cafe fresh food is sold on this flight The EMS seats have lots of leg room which is great Our flight attendants both ways were friendly and efficient and complimentary snacks and beverages available at all times Since we were on an international flight the movies were free but they charge 3 for headphones which I feel JB should comp for the EMS rows Overall a great experience We use this service twice annually to visit our home in CR", "Flew between New York JFK and Fort Myers Checked in online and bag drop at JFK was quick and easy Flight left on time was 45 mins quicker than originally advised Leg room was excellent much better than most international airlines complimentary in flight soft drinks and snacks all in all a very good experience and we will use Jetblue again", "I flew from Boston to Philadelphia with Jetblue on Monday August 25th The Airline was punctual and the seats were decent Great airline to use domestically", "Flew Mint Class from LAX to JFK and were impressed with the overall experience We live in Asia and fly Business or First Class on some fantastic full service Asian based airlines but this Jetblue Mint experience can easily beat most of them We took the 7am flight on a heavy 100 percent full A321 flight The check in was smooth with a nice welcome from the ground staff Our luggage were slightly oversize and above the max 50 pounds allowance per piece but they were flexible on it hence we didn't need to pay the additional fees We arrived around 5 30 am hence only a few passengers on the security check and didn't bother to use the express line The boarding was announced at 6 15 am and the Mint passengers got to board first We were seated in 3A and 3C which is perfect for couple even though the single suite with sliding door in front and the back of our seats row 2 and 4 were more private The cabin crew were very helpful in explaining the Mint service seat functions and presented us with menu card The welcome drink with or without vodka were a delight It took us a while to learn the full features of the seat as they are so unique and not the usual features you find in other carriers The thick blanket noise canceling headphones power point container for your phones and sunglasses are very thoughtful The boarding was completed before 7am and the departure was on time We got to choose 3 out of five meals prepared by Saxon Parole which were delicious and nicely presented The Icecream by blue marble and Mah Ze Dahr cookies in a box were of good quality One feature we love the most is free and fast wifi as soon as we took off The non stop TV entertainment although not AVOD was cool and we could watch it as soon as we sat down The in massage seat function helped us to relax and dozing off for most 5 hours and 30 minutes flight I am 6 feet tall and I found the seat is comfortable and I was able to stretch flat out We arrived at JFK 10 minutes earlier than scheduled and were very happy with our experience Book early for extreme good value and highly recommend the Mint class to anyone looking for a fantastic First class experience at an affordable price", "HPN MCO No complaints seats were roomy Check in was easy both ways Great entertainment as you could actually watch live TV No meals offered short flight Basic refreshments Good value", "Took flight 1834 from Port au Prince to JFK on 10 17 14 What a great experience almost The personnel were exceptional They did everything right My seat was 1D since no one was in the exit row seats they let me move back and allowed my friend in coach to move next to me he is 6 ft 3 so that was great for him The attendants were on their game the whole trip and got me coffee after their normal serving time without a hitch Only problem was my seat sound connection crackled so I used the seat connection next to me No problem as long as no one is directly next to you", "I travel a fair amount 7 10 trips a year for biz and pleasure I am fine with zero amenties for short hauls but I am sorry Boston San Diego is a long flight I paid 90 extra for leg room and was still jammed in like a sardine There was nothing to eat except junk food salt or sugar or a cardboard sandwich for purchase No free wine or beer If I wanted a cheap blanket and pillow for the red eye home I had to BUY it and then had to own it I traveled to this business meeting with one carry on what am I supposed to do with my new jetblue bedding Talk about a throwaway anti environmental business model I had to pay for TV if I wanted it only good thing is free wifi I paid over 900 for the ticket Jet Blue should not treat their transcontinental flyers like this I would not recommend JB to anyone taking a trip longer than 90 minutes and I would only use them again if I could find no other carrier going to the destination", "On board Mint class from LAX to JFK Impressive in all aspects Seat entertainment food and service The other carriers better watch out Provided the pricing remains competitive I'm a convert", "I recently traveled round trip from Boston to Orlando I traveled out of Boston on September 14 2014 and we were about 20 minutes delayed leaving Boston due to the late arrival of the inbound flight I have to say it was a great flight and the pilot made up time arriving in Orlando for an on time arrival the crew were great plenty of legroom plenty of drinks and snacks The overall flight to Orlando was excellent Coming home to Boston yesterday was a different story the male flight attendant on the Orlando Boston route was extremely rude No smile as we boarded the aircraft no hello to the passengers just miserable I traveled with 2 friends on board the flight and the tray table was defective and the soda went all over my friends pants I went to ask this flight attendant for some paper towels and he rudely said get back to your seat because there was turbulence I understand the safety protocols when it comes to turbulence but at least take initiative to the passengers requests There was no apology from him for this defective tray table A female flight attendant who was so nice came to our aid", "We arrived at the airport before 2pm our flight was at 9 45 pm Usually when you arrive so far in advance JetBlue try to accommodate you on an earlier flight with no charge We had the chance to take the flight at 2 40pm JetBlue had space on that flight but they wanted to charge 50 per person group of 4 instead they put us on stand by for 7 hours I travel a lot because of my business and I have never had this issue with other airlines", "Flew LAX JFK return in Mint in Aug Sep 2014 Check in was fast and efficient although slightly hard to find the Mint line at JFK The food is some of the best I've had inflight and beats any of the other American airlines I've flown hands down The seat was slightly narrow but the adjustable firmness and subtle massage made up for it Warm and efficient friendly cabin crew were very helpful but unobtrusive Flight to JFK departed 50 minutes late but landed on time Entertainment system is not on demand and the DirecTV has so many advertisements it is infuriating The feature movies were ad free though Overall a very good airline who I would definitely fly with again", "Flew on Jet Blue 1732 from Bermuda to JFK on Sunday 31 8 2014 Boarding was speedy well organised and efficient with everyone boarded and the plane doors closed 20 minutes ahead of schedule The flight left Bermuda 15 minutes early and arrived into JFK 25 minutes early which impressed me a lot Service provided by three polite smiling and delightful crew with drinks and snack run done fairly effortlessly and refills available and delivered with extra ice and a smile An impressive service that I really rated", "I'm writing about JetBlue's check in operations at Fort Lauderdale airport Apparently they have grown their operations there with insufficient and or unmotivated staff Trying to check in a bag for a recent flight to JFK took 45 minutes finally being called out of the line and being told you are too late All this while the lines got longer and their staff stood around chatting Out of 13 desks 6 were open while I counted at least 9 JetBlue staff hanging around doing nothing except chat Finally got to the gate only for their personnel there not having a clue about getting passengers onboard in a logical order They need to up their game at FLL or this passenger will be using another carrier next time On board service was good friendly and helpful which did mitigate some of the bad feeling about the FLL ground experience", "I flew on flight 1731 from JFK to Bermuda The flight was delayed so boarding started around 30 minutes late Boarding was pretty chaotic as the PA system was not working properly Onboard we were greeted by a friendly cabin supervisor who smiled and asked us how we were Once seated the flight was airborne within 20 minutes an hour later than scheduled Inflight service was efficient and friendly with drinks served individually from a tray rather than a trolley which was a nice touch with a free snack served from a basket Landing cards were handed out it would be great if they had a supply of pens The flight then arrived around 30 minutes late into Bermuda disembarkment was quick and I have to say I really enjoyed the flight", "August 20 2014 flight 124 We flew from LAX to JFK on Mint I can honestly say that I was very impressed I have flown business class on many international airlines and the on board service was comparable in every way The food was excellent best I have had on any airline Flight attendants were friendly courteous and very attentive and our bags were the first to arrive at the carousel as promised Furthermore the seats reclined to a flat position All in all a great trip The one suggestion for JetBlue is to have a small lounge area to accommodate Mint customers at larger airports such as LAX", "Aug 17 New York JFK to Orlando Intl MCO Flight 883 First time I've flown with JetBlue and it was not a pleasant experience Told the flight delayed 15 minutes then another 15 minutes and so on The plane was at the wrong terminal and took them over an hour to get it to the right gate Boarding process was a farce very slow 'Snack' was a packet of Doritos served by miserable cabin crew De boarding also very slow and then waited ages for our luggage Only good points were that we got there in one piece and they have good leg room", "First time I've flown with JetBlue and very unimpressed Plane over one hour late slow boarding slow off boarding poor service waited ages for luggage Only good point is the legroom in coach class", "Flew from St Maarten to JFK New York An announcement came over the loud speaker asking if anyone wanted an upgrade I mistakenly thought that meant an upgrade to first class So I paid an extra 150 for my children and I to upgrade only to find out that I paid 150 for approximately a foot and a half extra leg room I would have never spent my hard earned money on that and I believe that should've been explained to me I will never fly jetBlue again", "Terrible airline I fly often with other airlines usually Southwest I've never waited so long to get my luggage 45 minutes one way and 50 on way home That's after my flight was delayed by almost an hour waiting on a flight crew Fly someone else if at all possible", "Flew Mint class from LAX to JFK in July Check in and boarding smooth and on time Fantastic crew helpful and kind yet unobtrusive Meal some of the best I've had inflight much better than BA and QR business long haul Entertainment system not AVOD so whenever announcements were made I'd miss parts of the film I was watching Good selection of entertainment though wifi never worked Seat was the suite style and very comfortable in all positions but surprisingly narrow in lie flat When trying to sleep I had to keep my arms over my chest like a mummy Still managed to doze off a few hours", "Was flying for work from Tampa to DC and back Good direct connection into Reagan at good prices so went for it The flight to DC was uneventful and pleasant A week later as I am returning I have checked in at DC and waiting at the gate when I get an email from my booking service provider 10 minutes before boarding time that my flight is cancelled No announcements at the gate or anything It just now has been changed from Tampa to Boston 25 minutes later they announce to go to another gate to see attendants for help After waiting nearly an hour to talk to the agents I am greeted by two very unhelpful or sympathetic agents Our flight was cancelled because there was a mechanical failure on the plane scheduled for Boston so they used the Tampa plane instead This information came from other customers in line who got it from their booking agents not the Jetblue agents serving us They tell me they can get me out two days later and if I want to get to Tampa the next day my best option is to cancel the return leg and book another flight with another airline as JetBlue doesn't have any partnerships So I go ahead and do that Book a flight for 300 with American for the next am and go to baggage drop area to collect my bag I had checked in earlier There I was told I could get vouchers toward the hotel dinner etc I collect my bag and am told by the agent there that since I cancelled my flight with JetBlue it is not in their hands any more and they can't compensate hotel etc She did offer me a 12 voucher to use toward snacks at the airport All in all this episode cost me an extra 400 extra hotel cabs new ticket I understand mechanical failures happen I travel a lot all of the world I was surprised how little these agents at the gate knew about how to handle people when their company is obviously letting them down A dull blank emotionless stare and the customers had to suggest alternate satisfactory solutions No proactive support", "I've flown Jetblue twice the first one was a good experience with no delays snacks beverages and nice crew The second one was terrible our flight JFK FLL was at 6am and we got to the airport at 1am the screens showed that our flight was cancelled and we waited until 3 30am to receive any attention from JetBlue staff They said that we would need to wait until tomorrow for another flight or we would need to go to LaGuardia Airport to take another flight in 2 hours offered no accommodation transportation to LGA or vouchers We had to take a taxi from JFK to LGA Fortunately we got our flight on time from LGA to FLL but we are really disappointed with this drawback I think this is the last time we will fly Jetblue", "My son boarded a JetBlue flight in SF at 5 59am on July 2 bound for Portland ME connecting at JFK in NYC The flight was diverted to Rochester N Y where it sat for 8 hours A JB agent in Rochester changed his connecting flight to Portland without checking to see if his connecting flight was on time in fact it too was delayed When he finally arrived at JFK at 11 30am he found that the new connecting flight on which he was re routed had been cancelled His original connecting flight however was the scheduled to depart JFK at 2 30 am Ultimately his original connecting flight was also cancelled The JB customer assistance desk was completely vacant and there were hour long waits on the phone A single gate agent was attempting to assist and her line was 100 feet long When he reached her she said his only option was a flight leaving at 10 30 pm on July 3 He finally obtained a seat on a flight to Boston departing at 11 am Eight hours later he walked past a gate at JFK that showed a flight to Portland at 1 30 pm which was never mentioned by the gate agent the previous night He managed to get on the flight All in all the worst nightmare air travel story I've ever heard Never fly on JetBlue", "Flew JFK ACK JFK very easy check in very comfortable Embraer 190 plane service on board was excellent both flights left on time I'll keep flying JetBlue whenever I can The seats were very comfortable", "JFK POS Unfortunately Jetblue has lost its edge and is now very similar to the other U S carriers The free snacks have been downgraded and are really cheap and not substantial enough for longer flights The majority of the flight attendants were friendly but one of them was extremely rude The seats however are pretty good much more comfortable than coach seats on the legacy carriers", "Very decent airline with great staff I flew MCO JFK and the whole flight was great I also found the food and snacks acceptable and the WIFI was great I would definitely fly Jetblue again", "My husband and I flew from Charleston to DCA on the second day of service 6 20 The flight plane crew seat snacks were excellent Jetblue on this flight provided directtv service which was great I have flown Delta US Air United recently None of these were as good as the Jetblue service I was extremely impressed and have already booed my next flight", "My daughter tried to fly from NYC to DFW Jet Blue has canceled one flight and delayed her two times and given 3 different excuses All other airlines are on time or less than 30 minutes delayed Thanks for a miserable experience JetBlue Estimated travel time from NYC to DFW 16 hours unless there is another delay", "Used to love JetBlue but my last trip a couple of days ago changed my perception The plane seemed to be old and in a poor condition Basically none of the creature comforts worked We had 2 seats The seat back on the 1st seat was broken and would not stay in the upright position The video screen on the 2nd seat worked but the screen itself would not stay put The reading lights did not work on either of the seats significant on a late night flight The plug for the audio on the 1st seat only worked occasionally There were plenty of open rows of seats but they all required us to pay extra so we could not be moved to those seats Otherwise our only option was to move from an aisle and middle seat to a window and middle seat It was a long flight JFK to SFO and we get up and walk around every hour or so and just did not want to impose on another probably sleeping passenger that frequently so declined this option Bottom line is that while the legroom was great and the people were friendly the seats were uncomfortable and plane appeared to be old and in disrepair Certainly not worth the extra money that we used to be willing to pay to be a passenger on a JetBlue plane rather than on a competitors plane", "BOS to SAN and SEA to BOS This is by far my favorite domestic US based airline and I preferentially fly them whenever I can They really do go the extra mile to make sure your flight is pleasant start to finish Gate hassles are minimal compared to United and Delta and in my opinion food beverages entertainment are far superior to any other airline in economy class Let's hope they don't change", "1st June from LAX to JFK Cabin crew were really unfriendly They didn't smile at all and I was under the impression that they felt that we were a burden the passengers I have traveled extensively and on many airlines I have to say this is the first time I have felt uncomfortable on a flight even to the point that I was reluctant to ask for anything from the cabin crew", "My flight was cancelled to NYC where I was supposed to have a 3 hour lay over before catching an international flight to London 2 hours before flight time JetBlue cancelled my flight and rebooked me on a flight the next day I spent over 1 hour on the phone with them mainly on hold while they were supposed to figure out how I could get from Rochester NY down to JFK in time for my flight After over an hour's wait a supervisor got back to me and said sorry nothing we can do flight is canceled due to weather I asked where was the weather problem As she was saying that there is a lot of rain in NYC I was looking at the weather com report that reported partly sunny skies at JFK Because of the weather excuse I cannot get compensation from my travel insurance I have lost a day of vacation will be late for a family wedding and have had to pay a hefty fee to rebook my flight overseas Thanks a lot Jet Blue", "I have not even boarded the plane yet and am already not happy with the airline Tavelling as a couple I tried to do an online checkin to secure seats next to each other Online checkin not available Please see the agent at the airport I went to Seattle airport 10 hours before the flight to ensure that we could get adjacent seats and was assured by agent at the check in counter we were sitting next to each other After receiving our boarding passes I noticed that we were in different rows and brought this to the agents attention Suddenly the only way to get adjacent seats were to upgrade or check at the gate At the gate it was the same story Yes we can get you adjacent seats for a small fee of 80 per person What a scam Next time I'll try hitchhiking to New York if the only other option is Jet Blue", "Great for national flights horrible for international Their TV's do not work Infantile movies weak service cheap chips and soda No nice hot meals or free wine like most others that fly internationally and they have high prices you can get cheaper flights with others and check two bags free get a hot meal free drinks like wine or beer or drinks Their service is so mediocre for international flights", "This was my first and last time on JetBlue I received a text stating my flight home from JFK ORD was cancelled No explanation No help from JetBlue Could not get through to them An email said they were working on rescheduling but that was the last I heard I suspect that the flight was empty on a Saturday night and they simply chose not to fly the plane Cost 600 to get home on AA where I found the flight crew so much more polished and professional than JB I will never fly JB again", "Flight from Tampa to JFK was delayed 3 5 hours made our party of 4 miss our flight to Portland ME Flight finally got to JFK at 11pm with 1 lost bag we made it to the car rental counter with 5 min to spare to drive 400 miles home No help from JetBlue They did offer us a flight to Portland at 6pm the following night Spent the entire day trying to call JFK to find missing bag 4 un returned calls Finally called Portland they had my bag and had no information I was looking for it I will never fly Jet Blue again", "3 hour delay departing and canceled flight on the return Staff were unprofessional and unhelpful on both legs Many TVs were broken around us 2 of our 4 plus other people and they could not care less Canceled flight cost us money in the end because we got sent to a different airport and had to get a car service to our original airport to get back to our own car They wouldn't compensate us for any of all these problems This was Newark to Orlando and back and I see that those JetBlue flights are notoriously delayed and or canceled", "It seems as though their customer service and on time flight performance has gone down tremendously My sister and I purchased two one way tickets from San Juan PR to JFK We were told by the personnel at the gate that our flight was being delayed approximately 4 hrs due to a plane in New York with mechanical problems Simultaneously we began receiving emails from the jetblue website telling us the delayed flight would depart at an earlier time The Gate personnel had no knowledge of this Bottom line is customers pay hefty fares for some flights particularly on weekends and we do expect these planes to leave on time We got to New York so late we missed our concert", "Round trip from Richmond VA to Ft Lauderdale FL Could not have been happier Plane took of on time both trips and arrived ahead of destination time The seats the snacks the flight attendants all good I thought they actually appreciated my business Also the 70 00 each way my husband and I saved on the bags was a real bonus First trip the Pilot actually came out of his cabin and talked to us before takeoff", "This was my very first flight taken for a business matter Without knowing what to expect being so inexperienced I prepared for the worst Thinking this would be a delayed or cancelled flight resulting in a late arrival I experienced a small delay before take off yet arrived at JFK on time The flight attendants were polite and went out of their way to accommodate passengers The flight crew kept passengers up to date on weather and arrival times All equipment functioned properly and my luggage was promptly returned JetBlue Airlines is certainly worth the money", "I've been flying back and forth with JetBlue for the past 6 years I fly once every other month At first I was so satisfied with the service that I have never flown with any other airline But lately the past year especially the service has gone downhill The staff used to be so friendly and always smiling My last Flight was in December my TV was not working when I informed the flight attendant I got nothing but attitude and her answer was I don't know what to tell you After six years of using them that was my last and final time", "Impressed by the customer service I received when I was delayed 4 hours at Newark Airport on March 27th 2014 on Flight 505 to Ft Lauderdale The customer service representatives kept passengers well informed they ordered pizza for passengers gave out free water and snacks and were happy to offer assistance to passengers who wanted to change their flights We had free inflight movies and also when we arrived at our destination we received an e mail stating that we were given a voucher for future flights for our inconvenience caused by the delay", "Newark NJ to Ft Lauderdale FL on the way to Costa Rica March 30th Transfer flight was cancelled after a few delays Instead of rushing to find people ways of getting to their destination staff promptly resorted to save face mode claiming it was not the fault of the airline On top of that false claim they refused to help reschedule a flight if it involved a different airline Therefore our party of 3 will have to pay extra to get a decent company to help us reach our destination Last time I deal with this airline", "I have always flown JetBlue and have had only positive experiences with them Their flights are always on time The seats are comfortable and clean The TV is free The bag check is free The snacks are free When my TV didn't work they gave me free cocktails for the rest of the plane ride to keep me entertained I've used them flying mostly from JFK to LA and from JFK to Florida and have never had an issue so I'm sure that those with negative experiences unfortunately were just dealing with flukes", "I flew with JetBlue for the first time when I missed my original flight in JFK and I was checked in for their JFK Phoenix service They have nice and new planes with more leg room My ticket was originally with British Airways and they did a great co operation with British Airways with booking me for the last minute flights and sending my untagged baggage all the way from Italy to Phoenix Plus they have very friendly staff I'm very satisfied", "Booked a flight from Las Vegas to Los Angeles The flight as first was delayed 2 hrs due to maintenance issues After 2hrs we were then told it was cancelled Couldn't get another flight until the next day I purchased tickets that same night with a different airline Extremely inconvenient Never will I fly jetBlue again", "Booked a flight with Jetblue for 12 30 13 Arrived at the airport and was told the flight was cancelled due to a maintenance issue and they couldn't get me out until 2 days later They had no reciprocal agreement except with American Airlines which did not fly to my destination The staff were not very helpful and to top it off my return flight was delayed 6 hours Not a pleasant experience", "I booked a flight 1 4 14 to Orlando from Hartford I was willing to pay a premium to include extra leg room due to a non stop flight option and pay 600 My flight was 7pm out of Hartford and expected to arrive in Orlando at 10pm A snow storm is approaching later tonight 6 8hrs after take off It's now 10pm stars are in the sky and I should have already been in Orlando I was told that the direct flight was cancelled at 6pm as I arrived at the JetBlue desk I received no email or text message I asked Jet Blue for other alternative options and they could not even come close to accommodate until next day Very premature to cancel a non stop flight They have lost a customer As a result I had to cancel my trip and drove home", "Our flight from JFK to St Lucia on 7th January was cancelled without informing us The weather was no excuse as the 6th had been a warm day in New York The airline did not inform us of this cancellation and we only found of it upon attempting to check in online We ended up cancelling and flying Caribbean Airlines which took off on time two hours before the JetBlue flight would have taken off", "I flew out of Hartford on December 10th I told the flight attendant my TV was not working and my daughters audio was not working There were other passengers on that flight having the same problem They had to reset the system but it didn't help The seats available to move to were not offered because they were extra room seats It made for a long trip It's just sad you pay so much money for this flight and you don't get full service", "My flight like the flights of thousands of others was cancelled when JetBlue grounded all aircraft from NYC and Boston on 6th January Fine I can understand and accept that extraordinary measures must be taken in extraordinary times The real shock unfurled when I was to encounter the 'customer service' team at JFK airport and I use this term very lightly After queuing for 4 hours we were all greeted by unhelpful and at some points outwardly aggressive staff My fellow passenger was told that he could not be re booked for 3 days When he pointed this out the 'customer service' agent's reply was very good I can see you can count not my problem I was grounded for 4 days and was only informed of the option of a hotel when I did some detective work with fellow passengers As I was flying due to a death in the family I ended up taking a 13 hour bus trip to Toronto where WestJet went out of their way to accommodate me In the end JetBlue's attempt at compensation was a 50 credit to fly on one of their flights in the future", "Flight 449 from Boston Logan airport to Orlando scheduled to depart on Jan 6 at 11 30 My first and last experiece with JetBlue was horrendous This airline managed to cause us 7 hours of delay with no explanation or compensation We were pushed from gate to gate three times then when we finally got a plane we had no crew then no pilot Then there were maitenance issues The part that baffles me is that there was no reason for the initial delay In theory when you book a flight there is supposed to be a plane available as well as a crew and pilot I have no idea how this was cause for delay aside from total imcompetance which was made up for by nothing except an announcement that there would be no running water on the flight In the future I will do myself a service by booking elsewhere even at the expence of a few extra dollars", "FLL JFK on Jan 6th 2014 Flight scheduled at 7 13 am arrived as FLL Jetblue Terminal at 6am as we had luggage to check in The terminal was packed but check in worked fine At 7am we were informed by the display at the gate that the flight was delayed 1 hour therefore departing at 8 13am At 8 30am still no news and no aircraft At 9am our aircraft shows up at the gate and the announcement said that in a matter of few minutes time to clean up the aircraft boarding would have started At 9 30 informed that there's no captain to fly the aircraft At 10 30 a captain shows up Boarding in 15 minutes is announced once again At 11am our captain walks out of the aircraft At 11 30 announcement says that a new captain was on his way At 11 45 the newly found captain shows up At 12 00 boarding actually starts and we finally took off at 12 30 with 5 hours 17 minutes delay During the flight the pilot explained that jetblue had a major operation challenges that morning", "Terrible experience on Sunday January 5 2014 at JFK They cancelled the flight on which we were booked a little over an hour before take off There was chaos in the airport due to the number of flights JetBlue cancelled at once and its unwillingness to assist the customers to find replacement flights They kept announcing over the loud speakers that they had no replacement availability for several days and that customers should not even try to rebook with JetBlue's airport personnel That is extremely inconvenient once one is at the airport with luggage We ended up buying new tickets on a JetBlue flight 6 hrs later but that flight after being delayed 3 or 4 times was also cancelled due to there not being a pilot or co pilot available That was 6 hrs after the scheduled departure time We found a JetBlue flight that had a few unoccupied seats and a sympathetic agent got clearance to allow us to swap our second ticket for that flight That one agent was the only helpful person we encountered at Jet Blue We still do not have our luggage which was set ticketed for the cancelled flight There was no time to retrieve it and still board the alternative flight we identified", "We flew on January 5th had to connect through Boston which was effected by the winter storm Our flight was supposed to leave at 6am but after an hour JetBlue said that it was still trying to locate one flight attendant After only minimal updates at 11am they were able to take off however JetBlue never provided any information on how it would handle connecting flights When you asked you received a different answer each time from a different airport personnel When the flight landed at Boston there were no personnel to assist those that missed connections there was no communication from the flight deck on missed connections and each counter agent in Boston was dismissive Very disorganized not helpful a free for all environment left it up to you to find your way home", "JFK FLL JFK The flight was extremely inexpensive Flight left 20 minutes late but landed on time Even More Space Seat was worth the cost to avoid the TSA line at JFK alone but the room onboard was great The flight was smooth but the audio jack was overused and my headset plug was constantly falling out if I moved the wrong way Return flight was not as smooth the gate changed 6 times at FLL and was very confusing IFE was not working at my seat but was given a 15 voucher for future flight although it expires within the year Flight was also moderately turbulent with no feedback from the flight crew Flight back was not in Even More Space but was still roomy enough for a big guy like me JetBlue isn't perfect but much better than most that fly out of the area", "My flight was on 12 17 2013 from Boston to Seattle 1 connection in Philly with Alaska Airlines Delayed 2 3 hours from original departure time which is around 3pm Around 4 23 they told us to get onboard but kept us inside for 2 hours until we finally took off Because of this we missed our connection from PHIL to SEA and I am stuck in PHIL Called JetBlue and asked them to accommodate us with another flight from PHIL to SEA today and they wont do it Asked them to at least pay for the lodging tonight because we stuck in PHIL and they wont do it On a brighter note Alaska are willing to put us in a flight back today for free", "If you're traveling with children don't pick this airline We flew 5 5 hours to New York and not one not two but all three of the TVs provided for our kids didn't work You can imagine our flight experience What was Jet Blue willing to do for this A 15 credit only if we fly on Jet Blue again and only if we pay for another flight with them within the next year So for our inconvenience we get to book and pay for another flight with them Oh and they refused to allow the credit to be used on the flight for the trip home", "My flight check ins were seamless I have never flown on an airline with so much legroom for the standard coach or 3rd class Clean and comfy seats nice variety of channels Wish they had complementary meals for the flights that are 5 hrs long Flew from BUF SFO everything went smoothly on time departures Flights from SFO BOS BOS JFK and JFK BUF were delayed and they apologized for that Customer service in BOS was good but customer service in JFK wasn't good at all Either way I'd still recommend this airline to family and friends", "PBI HPN then HPN PBI Best flight by far of my jetblue experience every flight took off on time and smooth flights all the way The Big Plus great leg room TV's at every seat and good seat recline Will definitely fly again", "Polite helpful staff Never a rushed response Excellent DFW staff and crew on flight to BOS I need wheelchair assistance it was available each time without delay", "Flight from SJU to DCA on Dec 1 was delayed 2 5 hours without explanation or apology Conflicting flight information on departure boards and unhelpful announcements from ground staff", "Return JFK LIR 11 9 JFK LIR #1691 11 16 LIR JFK #1692 Both going and coming back the JetBlue experience was what you would expect for a low cost airline these days On time departure Good communications from the flight deck Flight attendants were in the cabin offering snack boxes and beverages Friendly and accessible Bottled water offered at the end of the flight was a nice touch", "Orlando for business trip generally fine my complaint specifically regards handling of baggage policies and staff lack of freedom to solve lost baggage problems checked 1 piece of luggage 28 minutes before the flight 2 mins too late it was not loaded on my flight didn't find out until arrival and going to baggage service told it would be on next flight 1 am but JetBlue staff hands are tied Customer has to return to the Airport to pick up their luggage or make arrangements on their own to have it shipped JetBlue baggage service called 7am to tell me to pick up my luggage finally agreed to send with 3rd party service for cash fee 30 It arrived after 4 pm so I attended my business meetings in dirty travel clothing JetBlue has got to figure out a better way I would rather pay upfront for luggage service than get free and no respect", "Overall the flight was fine However I noticed that the people that pay Even More Space and get to sit on an Exit Row will be seated with people that did not pay So do not buy Even More Space just go to airport and volunteer to go to Exit Row Even More Space and it will be Free", "JFK to LAX very good flight first time flying with Jet Blue very nice flight Leg room is good and crew were professional offering prompt service and the captain explaining weather and how long he expected turbulence to last etc The only negative on the flight was being a vegetarian there was only the quinoa salad available for a meal and by the time they got to our row 16 they had run out as there were apparently only 7 or 8 salads They handled it very well were really polite and gave me a snack box free of charge but I think I should be able to order a proper meal on a 6 hour flight The return flight was not as good staff were a bit indifferent we were delayed 1 5 hours with no explanation or apology and it took 40 mins for the first bag to arrive in the baggage claim area Would fly with them again", "BOS LAX A320 Full flight but boarding was made efficient and completed rather quickly Seats and entertainment were really showing there age with any bumps the screen flickered and the window seat in my row cut out a couple times for that person Also the audio was not working well which was caused by headphones with a microphone apple iPhone headphones However when I mentioned the issue the attendant kindly gave me a jetblue set which worked fine Flight was good with snacks and drinks", "Flew JFK HOU JFK for supposedly a budget airline the seats were better than some business class seats on European airlines Flights left on time and the service was very good Price of ticket was less than the other U S airlines and as someone used to budget airlines in Europe it was a nice change not to have to pay to check baggage in", "Flew Jetblue 8th October JFK SJC Flight left and arrived on time friendly crew Highlight was the free check in luggage and snacks which you would not find on other domestic flights I would definitely fly Jetblue domestically", "First time flying with them and loved every minute of it Staff were excellent and so attentive Short flight to JFK from Buffalo and back but what a great experience Counter staff was a pleasure to deal with very accommodating and helpful Flight crews were excellent This is very short flight but they really get moving to make sure everyone is helped and fed in a short time frame", "I flew JetBlue 26 times in a 3 month time span going from DCA to BOS It is a great airline and a pleasure to fly The best is the legroom the nice flight attendants and the in flight entertainment On about 1 4th of my trips had heavy delays but that's because of weather and was unavoidable I had only one really bad flight that was delayed for about 4 hours but that was the worst of it There are no middle seats as the configuration is 2 and 2 and there are no carts the flight attendants use baskets of chips and put the soft drinks in the pockets of their apron I like that Then there is the in flight entertainment which makes the flight seem a lot shorter and pleasant I notice that the fares are usually competitive with American or Delta or in some cases a little more but its worth it in my opinion", "We traveled between July and September 2013 My friend travels with a portable kidney machine I notified them of this fact when I made the reservation by computer I was told he could bring the machine and another medical bag for free When it was time to board the plane they took everybody except the disabled persons first including children in strollers I think a person with a kidney machine should trump a child with a stroller for boarding When we got onto the plane I asked one on the flight attendants where we could store this somewhat heavy kidney machine She promptly told us there was no room to store it other than the overhead bin I told her I couldn't lift this machine over my head Another flight attendant and the disabled person lifted it into the overhead On the return trip we just decided to check it in The woman at the check in desk was very accommodating", "I took JetBlue twice within the last 10 days The first from Chicago to Boston the plane left more than an hour late than scheduled due to machinery problems and midway during the flight it was revealed to us that we were landing in Buffalo NY because the problems apparently had not been fixed I ended up getting home more than 5 hours later than scheduled that night I was issued a travel bank credit so I used this to take another JetBlue flight from LA to Boston a few days later thinking that the same thing probably cannot happen again Apparently I was wrong The flight was late again for another hour due to machinery problems While we were waiting on the tarmac I asked my husband to ask for a blanket as it felt a bit cold and the flight attendant wanted to charge us 5 for the blanket I can't help but think that you've wasted a total of 5 10 hours of our time in the past few days and you're asking us for 5 This is the last time I will take JetBlue unless they are significantly cheaper or have a much more convenient time than other options Which I don't think they do", "Very disappointed with the 5 6 hrs delay of arrival in Puerto Rico from LAX on 9 14 13 We flew in a day early of our embarkation for our 7 days Caribbean cruise and had our travel agent book us at the Sheraton San Juan so we could tour the place on the day of arrival on 9 14 13 Our flight was delayed due to radio problems after we left JFK on a connecting flight to San Juan We got diverted to Orlando Fla for refuelling and to have the problem fixed but heard that the radio problem was not fixed The plans we made were spoiled by this We arrived at the hotel quite late in afternoon Due to embarkation for our cruise the next day 9 15 it gave us limited time to do the activities we wanted It's our very 1st Jet blue flight and I'm really very disappointed", "Flight 264 SEA JFK Delayed 1 hour and Flight 263 JFK SEA On time Fast efficient check in Friendly staff Excellent onboard service Legroom was fantastic Flight attendants are funny and professional at the same time Free Snacks are great and they keep giving you more They give a whole can of pop and a small bottled water unlimited Inflight entertainment is wonderful Direct TV SIRIUS Music and some select movies for pay not on demand though They give complimentary Snooze kit on a red eye flight which consists of earplugs and eye shades Hot towel service is an added bonus They are better than the legacy carriers with only Virgin America as their closest competitor in terms of service and onboard comfort", "September 15 2013 my husband and I flew from Aruba to Boston and we had the best flight We were on Flt #774 it was wonderful the captain was very pleasant and the flight attendants could not be more accommodating and entertaining", "JFK CLT I've flown them often and the only complaint I can muster is their occasional delays The attendants were friendly as usual The free inflight Live DirectTV and Radio is better than most international airlines and I believe 36 in of legroom come standard though I may be wrong Free unlimited snacks and beverages are a nice addition considering it's only a 2 hour flight Their custom built Terminal 5 at JFK is excellent fast WiFi tons of power ports and lots of space and shops It makes the occasional delay quite bearable Leather seats are great and you can even purchase Even More Legroom which being quite short I've never needed to but the purchase also let's you use first class check in and security lines along with priority boarding The free checked bag is amazingly useful especially if you're connecting flight is international It's worth pointing out that you need to bring your own headphones or you'll have to purchase one for a dollar or two They are reusable though", "BOS PHL flight was cancelled 90 minutes before it was scheduled to take off The only reason given was weather However the later flight from BOS PHL was on time and other airlines were flying to PHL Instructed to get in the very long full service line While waiting in line received an email saying we were confirmed on the next available flight to PHL which happened to be the next day in the AM I suggested booking us on a different airline to PHL their response was we can't do that There was no attempt to accommodate us in any way While other airlines get you on another flight or at least get you a hotel room when a flight is cancelled Jet Blue just shrugs their shoulders I absolutely won't fly them again", "Took a short trip from IAD to JFK Good seats spacious legroom good entertainment including a small snack and a drink for a short flight Courteous staff In the future jetBlue will always be the first choice for domestic travel in the US The jetBlue terminal at JFK was nicely done", "Vegas to Long Beach August 12th On a recent trip we traveled 3 airlines Frontier United express and Jet Blue Jet Blue was by far the best airline Reasonable fare clean airplane plenty of leg room courteous staff Will

weather Will be going back to the legacy carriers which deliver people on time", "The one thing I can say that I liked about this airline was the cheap flight Unfortunately that is the only positive part of my entire flight from Boston to Phoenix The seats were so uncomfortable and the flight attendants were rude When I asked if the movie would start over if I bought a head seat she looked at me

a flight of theirs that actually took off at its scheduled departure in the past year or so There are constant delays with the excuse that it's due to weather issues when I know there are no bad weather patterns from where I am to where I'm going They use it as an excuse so that they don't have to pay the customers any money for retribution Then once on my flight they are in a hurry to only offer the limited free menu items We are not offered any drinks or complimentary snacks besides peanuts and soda Flight attendants are also in a rush for people to get off their cell phones and become rude This past flight they did just that and then we continued to sit on the runway for an additional half an hour during which time I used my cell phone because we weren't going anywhere I do not recommend JetBlue despite their reasonable prices", "Flight 994 from Denver to Boston on August 4th 2013 Flight left late because of computer troubles However this was not the problem Upon

almost 2 hours before they asked us to get off due to weather Later on we find out that only JetBlue had cancelled all their flights to FLL Airport and we were stuck in Syracuse There were no weather issues and it seems that JetBlue is known for using this excuse in order not to pay or credit their customers We didn't leave on Sunday July 15th instead JetBlue said that the only available flight to make it to Florida was on Monday July 16th from Syracuse NY to Orlando Florida On top of that they didn't provide us with any credit to spend the night or for the inconvenience of flying to Orlando

others who were going to our cruise couldn't make it either because the airport in Florida was closed We knew this was untrue because our other family from another city had a flight to Florida the same time we did and they were able to check in and everything After about 30 minutes of trying to negotiate with them we decided to get a refund Being disappointed we called in to the cruise company

they offer TV for all passengers and it's good TV They offer food And the best was the lack of the service cart How wonderful it was to not have to compete with the cart or time your bathroom trips so

also had free access to certain SiriusXM stations as well The service overall onboard was good giving us good complimentary drinks and snacks Checking in and boarding the flight to EWR was smooth even though there was 15 minute delay due to a deluge at the airport The only consequence is that if you don't bring your headset you would have to pay for your own which is 2 Before they used to give them

unavailable We showed up at the airport to check in and were told we could not be guaranteed our seats would be together unless we purchased the extra legroom seats which we did not want We felt we were forced to pay the extra 40 per seat so we could sit together We again had the same poor experience on the way home I am extremely unhappy with this experience and feel I have been ripped off", "They now have their Even More Speed security lanes but it was useless I got to walk right up and show my ID and boarding pass but it still took 30 mins to get through security Crew was pleasant as usual but the pilot never said a word to us Jetblue pilots usually stand in front and introduce themselves tell you the length of the flight weather etc This one said nothing Legroom is great and snacks are always appreciated Yet for the second time in a row IFE didn't work Half the channels didn't work along with several radio stations as well I fear they are turning into just another US carrier", "IAD JFK Booked as a codeshare flight with South African Airways Flight was late out of IAD but that is pretty common on these East Coast morning flights I was happily surprised with the legroom and PTV Flight Attendants were friendly", "FLL NAS on Embraer Short pleasant flight Due to short flight there wasn't full drink service but everyone had bottle of water on seat when boarding Choice of two complimentary snacks Direct TV radios and airshow were available at any seat Seats were comfortable with nice legroom First bag is free on all flights Before departure captain came out of cockpit and made welcome announcement facing cabin Cabin crew were nice Waiting time for baggage at NAS could be better", "Unlike other airlines I don't have to worry about my bags going missing and I don't have to pay a bag check in fee They don't have First Class because they don't need it They have more leg room than others and snacks and drinks Every seat has a personal TV with free Direct TV and Radio for your entertainment", "My daughter was booked on an early morning flight she got to the airport before 5am and was told her flight was canceled My daughter repeatedly asked for help in arranging another flight and received none from Jet Blue personnel she found them unhelpful and rude and kept repeating they were sorry but there was nothing they could do She was left to wander around a large metropolitan airport to arrange her own flight Although I tried many attempts to resolve the problem JetBlue were very unresponsiveness and offered no real resolution", "We sat for 4 hrs on the tarnac on 2 different planes On the second flight out of Dulles did not leave until 11pm and we did not arrive in Boston until 1am We lost our connection for permission to fly which does not happen we misconnected 3 times Service is horrible a very disorganized airline I must say however some people were very helpful and did help accommodate us", "Every leg of the trip was delayed plane was very hot and we missed our connection They wanted to charge us for rebooking after we missed our connection and were faced with a rude employee at the desk at JFK", "LGB SMF return same day Cocktails way overpriced cabin attendants slow not very friendly and one on the SMF LGB jaunt was downright rude A320 was OK", "JFK FLL Received free upgrade to Even More Legroom seat Very spacious and wide seat with Direct TV Drinks and free chips were served Crews were very friendly and service was very good", "BOS IAD A dreadful experience The flight was delayed and no information on further delays although they were obvious e g crew lining up at what was supposed to be the departure Well worn seats Once on the plane we could not depart for 1hr They easily could have kept us at the gate The satellite radio is mostly obscurities and a lot of programming for political conservatives and evangelical Christians It struck me as a very cheap product although one has to pay for earphones if a passenger doesn't have their own Indifferent flight attendants and unintelligible announcements The airline seems to be trading on its previous reputation for quirky friendly service", "SDQ JFK and also SJU a few times Great coach seats in leather I love the leg room it is really comfy on international flights they always provide free movies entertainment flight attendants provides a very nice impression and a great experience Their pilots are always saying goodbye to passengers when aircraft lands which means that they really appreciate our business with them", "FLL LGB LAS 2 of cabin crew called in sick so we had to wait for replacements who were very funny in good spirits Gate personnel kept us informed We left about 1hr late but made up time and got to Vegas only 20 mins behind schedule Sat in a row with extra legroom well worth the extra cost Food was ok TV great though some connection issues Only annoying thing was everyone had to deplane in LGB even if continuing to Vegas on same aircraft I actually had to move up a row Best domestic flight on my 25000 miles trip from Dubai to USA back", "Boston's Logan International Airport Tampa International Airport The flight to Tampa was excellent We sat at our original gate and we were early There was a flight to Austin that was delayed so they moved us to a different gate where people were confused and it took some time for us to get on the plane It was a smooth flight The entertainment system in front of me TV seemed to be unattached but still worked and there are enough channels for children and adults The cabin crew took great care of the passengers May I say that the landing was superb", "JFK SAN LGB JFK The flight to San Diego was one of the best I've been on in a long time Legroom is great free snacks first bag free lots of TV choices and satellite radio Crew was excellent Very enthusiastic and seemed to be enjoying their jobs so rare these days Bag drop is way too slow as was the baggage claim Their new meal packs for purchase are not worth the money On the return checkin and bag drop were better Crew was more average The flight was full of screaming babies Half the TV channels didn't work and the radio broke down halfway through the flight Jetblue is always promoting the free TV and radio but they break down frequently And as always the crew can not do anything but file a report", "This review is regarding the customer service at JetBlue com I had a complaint about a third party service I ordered through the jetblue web site I made the complaint through their web submission and they followed up and resolved the issue to my satisfaction I guess I shouldn't be surprised when an airline actually has good customer service but I am", "Flew Jetblue down to Tampa from JFK on Memorial Day Great experience Excellent leg room and seat width Entertainment system great Crew was great and attentive", "IAD FLL Was pleasantly surprised by JetBlue No bag charges on time flight drink and bag of chips included live TV and plenty of radio choice Much better than American Airlines", "I was very satisfied with our recent round trip Boston to Peurto Rico all the more so because I perceived JetBlue as a budget airline Check in moved very quickly and flight left on time both directions I was happy with inflight movies choice of free snacks and beverages Lots of legroom Attendants were pleasant and helpful", "JFK Buffalo JFK JetBlue Terminal 5 is new modern easily navigated and offers free Wifi Staff polite and helpful Outbound on A320 clean and well maintained Legroom best I've seen in coach on any airline Snacks and drinks offered shortly after take off by smiling and personal crew Flight landed on time in Buffalo Inbound on E190 this time also with smiling and personal crew Both aircraft feature in flight entertainment AVOD free snacks and drinks and the best cabin crew I've experienced on any US airline A great product which I recommend", "BOS to SAN poorly maintained aircraft indifferent flight attendants My reading light did not work and at least 4 others within hearing distance did not either Then the TV system froze for almost the whole flight unwatchable It was an evening flight so to pass the time I'm trying to read using the light from the illegible TV Stuff happens but the flight attendants didn't seem to care no apology certainly nothing to make up for the problems They just said that previous cabin crews must have not 'written them up' seemed to imply that not reporting the failures is pretty typical", "MCO BQN SJU MCO Great entertainment system cabin crew friendly Aircraft were clean seats comfortable and experience was great", "Great seats Wish we had been able to use jetBlue for our long flight to Costa Rica But the short flight was comfortable and the staff friendly Too bad they don't fly to all the places we go", "JFK San Juan round trip Only completed JFK SJU Return flight was cancelled I did not received the text message alert the night before the return flight Luckily I checked the flight status the night before and found out all flights SJU JFK were cancelled Called the reservation desk and after 30mins wait an agent assisted me to rebook Only could book a connecting flight that would take me home two days later So I had to book with another carrier AA to return home I understand the weather in NY was bad But AA still operated without problems JetBlue management took very extra cautious decision to cancel the operation on that day It was a bad call", "We fly several times a year from New York to Orlando and we only enjoy flying with Jetblue From online booking to telephone customer support it's easy and you build up your points or convert your american express points into true blue ones Jetblue terminal in JFK is the best planes are new equipped with tv's for all passengers The crew are nice and never refuse extra drinks or snacks during the flight If your bag is lost Jetblue give you a voucher right away without writing a request for any reimbursement", "JFK PDX Flight Crew very helpful and kept us in the loop about delays very professional and a great choice The Even More Legroom seats feel like First Class but don't have those large price tags attached", "LAX JFK MCO return last week Three flights on A320 and MCO JKF on E190 All aircraft in good condition At time of booking paid for extra leg room on all flights Money well spent Free TV channels worked flawless on all flights Smiling and very helpful crew on all flights jetBlue terminal in JFK clean and great to spend some time while in transit Free WIFI throughout the terminal as in MCO Terminal 3 in LAX is a dump and way too small for the amount of passengers handled through this terminal but T3 in LAX was the only negative aspect to a wonderful flying experience with jetBlue The fare paid incl fee for extra legroom was by far the lowest available", "The jet Blue experience was not good and marginally awful Flights have always been great and on time but the True Blue program is difficult time to access and is not what I would consider a Reward program Wrong and incomplete information leads to lost points and supervisors with no authority to make things right just ask me Very disappointed is a kind way to say where is Customer Commitment", "JFK via FLL for a business trip my only preferred airline to domestic cities Seats had plenty of legroom Flight attendants did a fabulous job They sure had a lot of patience considering some of the rude passengers onboard Service was great and ahead of schedule arrival in FLL", "Boston Fort Lauderdale Flown with JetBlue many times and generally happy with the service Aircraft clean well maintained and service is consistent though basic Extra legroom seats well worth the extra money especially now they seem to get priority boarding One gripe is the constant allowance of excessive cabin baggage which often results in late departures while stressed cabin crew offload bags that will not fit in the lockers Twice recently on my flights it has caused confrontation during boarding and angry passengers being very rude to the crew If only the ground staff dealt with the issue by enforcing the rules this would not happen Apart from that snacks ok and drink service fine", "Oakland to New York JFK round trip The airline offers very good service for the price including free unlimited snacks 36 free channels of tv smiling flight attendants and good legroom JFK connections were very efficient The only problem is that on the way home to Oakland from JFK the flight was delayed two hours because the flight crew and their backups had been stranded due to cancellations the night before", "FLL SJU FLL JetBlue offers a simple yet lovely air travel experience A320 leather seats individual IFE monitor and loads of legroom with 34inch pitch Snacks of a good quality and flight attendants friendly Carry on and first checked bag are free Headset is free A low fare airline providing a top notch experience", "BOS JFK The flight was delayed without any explanation No greeting while boarding with a bored flight attendant at the door The plane was clean I had booked an extra space seat and I was not disappointed The drink and snack service was ok for such a short flight and the TV was great Overall not impressed by the attitude of the crew which is much more efficient and friendly on Virgin America", "JFK to Austin TX I really thought the competitive advantage that Jetblue had over other airlines was the CEO vision of being a friendly airline I remember the blue chips and jokes that the crews made before take off when Jetblue started up That is no longer the case An older gentleman in the front row of my flight asked for a snack while the flight attendant was taking beverage orders She spoke to him in a very rude tone and stated that she would not serve any snacks until she was finished with the beverage service The gentlemen had no time between flights to eat The food was an arm length away from her but she refused She was very rude to another woman who placed her carry on in an overhead two rows up from her seat She made her move it one compartment over And Jetblue what is with the manual emergency instructions with built in televisions we have to watch a manual instruction Jetblue will not see me back as a customer The prices are higher than the other airlines unless they are flying you on a special The rude crews and the fact that JFK is the hub for Jetblue is enough reason for me to shop elsewhere", "Comfortable seats with plenty of leg room free snacks and first checked bags friendly staff They occasionally face delays mechanical problems etc but as someone who flies them about once a month I can say that the vast majority of their flights are a joy", "My work required last minute travel to New York City from Buffalo New York on a recent weekday morning JetBlue website was easy to use and I booked a reasonably priced roundtrip flight Flight to JFK was fine with just a slight delay departing BUF However departure of return flight was delayed just about 3 hours but just 1 2 hour at a time Two male flight attendants were a bit gruff and bossy with the passengers which has never been the case with many other JetBlue flights", "A fantastic flight Tampa to Boston Our trip home was also smooth and fun for the kids and parents Flight attendants professional and nice and the pilots informative", "My family took a flight to Disney and it was the most perfect airline experience The seats were comfortable there was a wide assortment of refreshments The trip was smooth sailing Coming home we did experience a 45 minute wait time due to weather But the captain kept us fully informed and we were on our way as soon as the weather permitted", "CLT JFK Getting through CLT check in security was easy the one free bag was a nice touch as well Boarding on time from CLT's new D terminal which offers good food and plentiful seating Boarding on time and welcomed by a somewhat friendly female flight attendant who just continued to say Hi Hi Hi No welcome aboard Plenty of legroom and IFE was already turned on Smooth flight chips and a drink were for 1 5 hour flight The same female flight attendant was rude in asking an unaccompanied minor to Turn down your headphones We can hear them in the front T5 at JFK is amazing Overall great flight much better value than US and DL who fly this route", "ROC JFK LGB Return Rochester NY to JFK a new Embraer E190 Seat wide enough with enough legroom even for a large person such as myself Short flight less than an hour in the air JFK LGB in a reasonably new A320 All flights on time or a little early Flight attendants were reasonably outgoing and cheerful yet professional JFK LGB leg they let me have all the liquids I desired I knew beforehand all JetBlue offers are snacks so I brought food along for the long
